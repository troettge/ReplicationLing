"Baus, Cristina; Costa, Albert; Carreiras, Manuel",Neighbourhood density and frequency effects in speech production: A case for interactivity,LANGUAGE AND COGNITIVE PROCESSES,"In three experiments, we explore the effects of phonological properties such as neighbourhood density and frequency on speech production in Spanish. Specifically, we assess the reliability of the recent observation made by Vitevitch and Stamer (2006), according to which the neighbourhood effect in Spanish has a reverse polarity to that observed in other languages. In Experiment 1, we replicate Vitevitch and Stamer's (2006) experiment, this time adding a control group. The same inhibitory neighbourhood effect found for both groups can not corroborate the hypothesis posited by Vitevitch and Stamer. In Experiment 2, our results show that native speakers of Spanish named pictures with words belonging to high density neighbourhoods faster than those belonging to low density neighbourhoods. In Experiment 3, we test for effects of neighbourhood frequency during lexical selection. Again, we find a facilitatory effect for words with a high-frequency neighbourhood. Together, the results of the present experiments suggest that lexical selection is facilitated by the number of neighbours and by neighbourhoods with higher frequency. These findings are consistent with the predictions of interactive models.",29,,2008,23,6,866,888,,10.1080/01690960801962372,1,1,one of several experiments is a replication,0,"Vitevitch, M.

"BRADLEY, DC; SANCHEZCASAS, RM; GARCIAALBEA, JE",THE STATUS OF THE SYLLABLE IN THE PERCEPTION OF SPANISH AND ENGLISH,LANGUAGE AND COGNITIVE PROCESSES,"A series of monitoring studies is reported, in replication of the cross-language research of Cutler, Mehler, Norris and Segui (1983; 1986), which found evidence of language-specific perceptual routines. Monolingual speakers of Spanish and English detected CV and CVC target sequences in native and non-native materials. The replication succeeded only in the case of Spanish speakers and Spanish materials, where a cross-over interaction of target (CV vs CVC sequences) and carrier types (CV- vs CVC-syllabified words) gave evidence of a sensitivity to the input's syllabification; no such pattern emerged for Spanish speakers and English materials, nor for English speakers and materials in either language. For English speakers, the consistent finding was for faster performance with CVC targets, regardless of the structure of the carrier word. Whether or not this is to be interpreted as evidence of syllabified input representations is not clear. Analyses of English syllabification that are alternatives to that adopted by Cutler et al. exist, to weaken the original contrast drawn between syllable-favouring and syllable-disfavouring languages. A final experiment examines monitoring performance in Spanish speakers who have become bilingual as a consequence of emigration to an English-speaking country; these subjects showed no syllable sensitivity for Spanish language materials. We speculate that factors outside the perceptual system may determine the basis on which responses are made in the monitoring task, and therefore conclude that the case for language specificity in perceptual routines has yet to be made.",73,MAY,1993,8,2,197,233,,10.1080/01690969308406954,1,1,one of several experiments is a replication,0,"Cutler, A., Mehler, J., Norris, D. & Segui, J.

"Branigan, Holly P.; Catchpole, Ciara M.; Pickering, Martin J.",What makes dialogues easy to understand?,LANGUAGE AND COGNITIVE PROCESSES,"Two experiments investigate the question of why dialogues tend to be easier for anyone to understand than monologues. One possibility is that overhearers of dialogue have access to the different perspectives provided by the interlocutors, whereas overhearers of monologue have access to the speaker's perspective alone (Fox Tree, 1999). Directors first described a set of geometric shapes to matchers in monologue or dialogue eight times. Experiment 1 found that descriptions taken from dialogue were easier to understand than descriptions taken from monologue or descriptions taken from dialogue in which the matcher's contributions were excised. This advantage occurred on early trials (when the matcher made a considerable contribution) but also on late trials (when the matcher simply accepted a description). Experiment 2 replicated this finding and ruled out an explanation in which the advantage of dialogue is due to its use of discourse markers. We argue that the ease of dialogue occurs because interlocutors negotiate a perspective that they can agree on (Clark, 1996). This grounded perspective is likely to be objectively easier to understand than a perspective that has not been grounded.",15,,2011,26,10,1667,1686,,10.1080/01690965.2010.524765,1,1,inner-paper replication,0,same,same,1,2011,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,partial,English,NA,15,,
"Braun, Bettina; Tagliapietra, Lara",On-line interpretation of intonational meaning in L2,LANGUAGE AND COGNITIVE PROCESSES,"Despite their relatedness, Dutch and German differ in the interpretation of a particular intonation contour, the hat pattern. In the literature, this contour has been described as neutral for Dutch, and as contrastive for German. A recent study supports the idea that Dutch listeners interpret this contour neutrally, compared to the contrastive interpretation of a lexically identical utterance realised with a double peak pattern. In particular, this study showed shorter lexical decision latencies to visual targets (e.g., PELIKAAN, opelicano) following a contrastively related prime (e.g., flamingo, oflamingoo) only when the primes were embedded in sentences with a contrastive double peak contour, not in sentences with a neutral hat pattern. The present study replicates Experiment 1a of Braun and Tagliapietra (2009) with German learners of Dutch. Highly proficient learners of Dutch differed from Dutch natives in that they showed reliable priming effects for both intonation contours. Thus, the interpretation of intonational meaning in L2 appears to be fast, automatic, and driven by the associations learned in the native language.",7,,2011,26,2,224,235,PII 923379546,10.1080/01690965.2010.486209,1,1,replication of previous experiment by the same authors,0,"Braun, B., & Tagliapietra, L.

"Brouwer, Susanne; Mitterer, Holger; Huettig, Falk",Speech reductions change the dynamics of competition during spoken word recognition,LANGUAGE AND COGNITIVE PROCESSES,"Three eye-tracking experiments investigated how phonological reductions (e. g., puter for computer) modulate phonological competition. Participants listened to sentences extracted from a spontaneous speech corpus and saw four printed words: a target (e. g., computer), a competitor similar to the canonical form (e. g., companion), one similar to the reduced form (e. g., pupil), and an unrelated distractor. In Experiment 1, we presented canonical and reduced forms in a syllabic and in a sentence context. Listeners directed their attention to a similar degree to both competitors independent of the target's spoken form. In Experiment 2, we excluded reduced forms and presented canonical forms only. In such a listening situation, participants showed a clear preference for the canonical form competitor. In Experiment 3, we presented canonical forms intermixed with reduced forms in a sentence context and replicated the competition pattern of Experiment 1. These data suggest that listeners penalize acoustic mismatches less strongly when listening to reduced speech than when listening to fully articulated speech. We conclude that flexibility to adjust to speech-intrinsic factors is a key feature of the spoken word recognition system.",37,,2012,27,4,539,571,,10.1080/01690965.2011.555268,1,0,no clear communication of intent to replicate an original study,0,,,,,NA,,,,,,,NA,,NA,37,,
"CARREIRAS, M; GERNSBACHER, MA",COMPREHENDING CONCEPTUAL ANAPHORS IN SPANISH,LANGUAGE AND COGNITIVE PROCESSES,"This paper examines the mechanisms involved in the assignment of an antecedent to an anaphoric element. In general, pronouns must match their antecedents at least with respect to number and gender. Sensitivity to such constraints has been shown in several experiments. But Gernsbacher (1991) has also shown that people have no difficulty comprehending a plural pronoun with an antecedent that is grammatically singular but conceptually plural. In the first three experiments, we tested whether such a conceptual effect was preserved with zero anaphors in Spanish. (The typical omission of pronouns in subject position in Spanish.) Verbs in a second clause were marked with plural or singular endings. Plural verbs were rated more natural than singular verbs when they followed three types of singular but conceptually plural antecedents (Experiment 1). Clauses containing plural verbs were read faster when they followed one type of singular but conceptually plural antecedents, i.e. collective sets (Experiments 2 and 3). In fact, clauses containing plural verbs were read equally fast when they followed literally singular collective sets or explicitly group nouns. Using pronominal anaphors, these reading time effects were replicated and extended to sentences that contained generic types as antecedents (Experiment 4). The results are discussed in terms of the use of information during the comprehension of anaphors.",21,AUG-NOV,1992,7,3-Apr.,281,299,,10.1080/01690969208409388,1,0,no clear communication of intent to replicate an original study,1,,,,,NA,,,,,,,NA,,NA,21,,

Like in Spanish, word recognition performance was inhibited in a lexical decision and a perceptual identification task when the first syllable of a word was of high frequency.

"Content, A; Meunier, C; Kearns, RK; Frauenfelder, UH",Sequence detection in pseudowords in French: Where is the syllable effect?,LANGUAGE AND COGNITIVE PROCESSES,"In two experiments, French speakers detected cv or cvc sequences at the beginning of disyllabic pseudowords varying in syllable structure and pivotal consonant. Overall, both studies failed to replicate the crossover interaction that has been previously observed in French by Mehler, Dommergues, Frauenfelder and Segui' (1981). In both experiments, latencies were shorter to cv than to cvc targets and this effect of target length was generally smaller for cvc. cv than for cv. cv carriers. However, a clear crossover interaction was observed for liquid pivotal consonants under target-blocking conditions, and especially for slow participants. A third experiment collected phonemegating data on the same pseudowords to obtain estimates of the duration of the initial phonemes. Regression analyses showed that phoneme duration accounted for a large proportion of the variance for cvc target detection, suggesting that participants were reacting rather directly to phonemic throughput.

Participants' performance was not affected by the relationship between the gender of the picture and the gender of the word. The results show that the gender congruity effect is not a universal effect, but varies from language to language, depending on crucial characteristics of the gender/determiner selection system used to process a given language. Consistent with the crosslinguistic hypothesis presented by Miozzo and Caramazza we argue that the retrieval of the noun's gender is enough to specify the determiner's phonological form in Dutch, but not in Catalan or Spanish, and this is the cause of the failure to replicate the Dutch results in these two languages.",42,AUG,1999,14,4,381,391,,10.1080/016909699386275,1,0,no clear communication of intent to replicate an original study,0,,,,,NA,,,,,,,NA,,NA,42,,
"Dominguez, A; deVega, M; Cuetos, F",Lexical inhibition from syllabic units in Spanish visual word recognition,LANGUAGE AND COGNITIVE PROCESSES,"In Spanish, there is some empirical support for the notion that, in visual word recognition, the syllables initially activate competing lexical candidates (Carreiras, Alvarez, & De Vega, 1993). This lexical activation, however, requires an inhibitory mechanism to select the appropriate lexical entry. The experiments presented here aimed to explore these inhibitory processes. A priming paradigm was used in which the prime and the target shared the first syllable (norma-norte), the initial letters but not the first syllable (noria-norte) or were unrelated (mando-norte or savia-norte). Subjects performed a lexical decision task on the targets and the results showed, in general, interference on the related pairs. When the frequency of mention of the prime was less than that of the target, an inhibitory effect was obtained for the same syllabic pairs but not for the same letter pairs (Experiment 1). When the frequency of mention of the prime was increased to promote direct processing of the target, the inhibitory effect extended to both conditions of related pairs (Experiment 2). Finally, the use of pseudoword primes (Experiment 3) replicated the basic pattern of results in Experiment 1. The applicability of the data to a dual-route model and the time course of syllabic processing is discussed.",37,AUG,1997,12,4,401,422,,10.1080/016909697386790,1,0,no clear communication of intent to replicate an original study,0,,,,,NA,,,,,,,NA,,NA,37,,

Experiment 1 replicated the manipulation used by Dunabeitia, Perea, and Carreiras (2007), testing transposed-letter (TL) priming effects spanning the boundary between the affix and the stem. In contrast to their finding observed with the lexical decision task, TL priming effect did not vanish with polymorphemic or pseudomorphemic words. Experiment 2 used the manipulation used by Rastle, Davis, and New (2004), comparing the effects of polymorphemic affixed words (e.g., walker), pseudo-affixed words (e.g., corner), and nonaffixed monomorphemic words (e.g., brothel) in target word recognition.

"Emmorey, K; LilloMartin, D",Processing spatial anaphora: Referent reactivation with overt and null pronouns in American Sign Language,LANGUAGE AND COGNITIVE PROCESSES,"Unlike English, American Sign Language (ASL) permits phonologically null pronouns in tensed clauses. Null pronouns are licensed by morphological marking of ''agreeing'' verbs which agree with the spatial loci of the subject and object noun phrases of the sentence. We present two probe recognition experiments which investigated whether overt and null pronouns similarly reactivate their referents during on-line sentence comprehension. Experiment 1 revealed faster response times to probes that were referents of either an overt pronoun or a null pronoun compared to control probes, indicating that both overt pronouns and null pronouns associated with verb agreement reactivate their spatial referents. However, response times to non-referent probes were also faster than to control probes, and it was hypothesised that an end-of-sentence probe presentation may have tapped into a sentence integration process in which all possible referents were reactivated. In a second experiment, the same sentences were presented to a second group of subjects, but probe signs were presented before the end of the sentence, and 1000 msec after the anaphoric element. The main results of the first experiment were replicated (both overt and null pronouns reactivated their referents), and responses to non-referent probes were not significantly different from control probes. Both experiments indicated that (1) there is an important link between spatial verb agreement and the ASL pronominal system, and (2) non-referent inhibition does not have the same processing status in ASL as it does in English.",8,DEC,1995,10,6,631,653,,10.1080/01690969508407116,1,0,no clear communication of intent to replicate an original study,0,,,,,NA,,,,,,,NA,,NA,8,,
"Grosjean, F; Hirt, C",Using prosody to predict the end of sentences in English and French: Normal and brain-damaged subjects,LANGUAGE AND COGNITIVE PROCESSES,"In an earlier study (Grosjean, 1983), it was found that listeners of English were surprisingly accurate at predicting the temporal end of a sentence when only given the part up to the ''potentially last word'', that is a noun before an optional prepositional phrase of varying lengths. The present study investigated this phenomenon in four experiments. The first two experiments examined the prediction capabilities of listeners when presented with the whole sentence in segments of increasing duration and when presented with the potentially last word only. The results indicate that to be able to use prosody to predict the end of sentences correctly, subjects must have reached a point in the sentence where neither syntax nor semantics can contribute to the prediction process. The third experiment investigated whether the results obtained with English can be replicated in French, a language with a very different prosodic structure. It was found that unlike their English counterparts, French listeners were unable to differentiate between sentences that continued, although they could tell if a sentence ended or not. Finally, the fourth experiment examined whether left and right hemisphere brain-damaged (LHD, RHD) patients are equally proficient at estimating the length of a sentence. LHD patients behaved like their controls, but RHD patients experienced great difficulty doing the task. This confirms that sentence prosody may well involve the right hemisphere, especially when no other type of linguistic processing is involved. The extension of these studies to other types of linguistic material and to other languages is discussed, as is the on-line use of prediction in language processing.",47,FEB-APR,1996,11,1-Feb.,107,134,,10.1080/016909696387231,1,1,one of several experiments is a replication,0,"Grosjean,  F.

Distractors were morphologically related, merely form-related or unrelated to the German translations (target words). The transparency of the semantic relation between target words and morphological distractors was also varied. Morphological distractors facilitated word-translation latencies irrespective of their semantic transparency, replicating results obtained with other tasks. Thus, in German word production, effects of morphological complexity seem to be largely independent of semantics. Morphological facilitation is also not due to mere form relatedness, since phonological distractors had no impact on translation latencies, relative to unrelated distractors.

Likelihood judgements were also found to correlate between modified and unmodified versions of sentences.

We, however, propose that the P600 is not restricted to reanalysis processes, but reflects difficulty with syntactic integration processes in general.

Next, in Experiment 1, we show that the P600 is elicited in grammatical, non-garden path sentences in which integration is more difficult (i.e., who questions) relative to a control sentence (whether questions). This effect is replicated in Experiment 2. Furthermore, we directly compare the effect of difficult integration in grammatical sentences to the effect of agreement violations. The results suggest that the positivity elicited in who questions and the P600-effect elicited by agreement violations have partly overlapping neural generators. This supports the hypothesis that similar cognitive processes, i.e., integration, are involved in both first pass analysis of who questions and dealing with ungrammaticalities (reanalysis).",496,APR,2000,15,2,159,201,,10.1080/016909600386084,1,1,inner-paper replication,0,same,same,1,2000,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,conceptual,English,NA,496,,

It has been claimed by Frazier and Rayner (1982) that subjects are garden-pathed when reading reduced complements (lacking the overt complemetiser), and that this fact is strong evidence in support of the application of the principle of Minimal Attachment as a universal property of the human parser. Holmes, Kennedy, and Murray (1987) questioned this conclusion by providing evidence that full and reduced complements present equivalent problems, probably because of their greater structural complexity. Rayner and Frazier (1987) disputed this conclusion, ascribing it to an artefact resulting from the use of a self-paced reading task. The first experiment examines this controversy with a replication of the study by Holmes et al., measuring eye movements as the sentences are processed. The results replicate those of the original study and further show that the effects cannot be attributed to lexical preferences associated with the verb. The second experiment examines the format of the displayed text as one possible reason for the discrepancy between the two sets of results. When sentences are displayed across several lines, the line breaks are interpreted by subjects as signals for potential clause endings, garden-pathing the reader.

The full-cascading view holds that all activated concepts automatically activate their lexical and phonological representations. The limited-cascading view holds that a selection procedure interrupts the automatic flow of information through the speech production system. Recently, the full-cascading view has received support from the observation that ignored pictures activate their phonological representation. In two experiments the conditions to observe this finding were examined. Using coloured pictures to name, we replicated the finding that when the picture's name is phonologically related to the name of its colour, the colour-naming task is facilitated compared with when the name of the picture is unrelated. We also show that this effect is stronger when naming the picture has been practiced. By contrast, the colour's name has no effect on naming the picture, not even when colour naming is practiced.

Prevor and Diamond's (2005) recent observation that children take longer to name the colour of real objects than of abstract forms could also be attributed to cascaded processing, resulting in competition between colour name and object name. Experiments 1 and 2 replicate this 'object-interference effect' in colour naming by children of 5-7 years of age and show that it generalises to position naming. Experiment 2 shows that the effect is also obtained with hard-to-name objects; a finding that is at variance with a lexical-competition account.

"Mathey, S; Robert, C; Zagar, D",Neighbourhood distribution interacts with orthographic priming in the lexical decision task,LANGUAGE AND COGNITIVE PROCESSES,"Lexical decision tasks (LDTs) were used with a masked priming procedure to test whether neighbourhood distribution interacts with orthographic priming. Word targets had either 'single' neighbours when their two higher frequency orthographic neighbours were spread over letter positions (e.g., neighbours of LOBE : robe-loge ) or 'twin' neighbours when they were concentrated on a single letter position (e.g., neighbours of FARD : lard-tard ). All word targets were preceded by their highest frequency orthographic neighbour or by a control prime.

"PRASADA, S; PINKER, S",GENERALIZATION OF REGULAR AND IRREGULAR MORPHOLOGICAL PATTERNS,LANGUAGE AND COGNITIVE PROCESSES,"Both regular inflectional patterns (walk-walked) and irregular ones (swing-swung) can be applied productively to novel words (e.g. wug-wugged; spling -splung). Theories of generative phonology attribute both generalisations to rules; connectionist theories attribute both to analogies in a pattern associator network; hybrid theories attribute regular (fully predictable default) generalisations to a rule and irregular generalisations to a rote memory with pattern-associator properties. In three experiments and three simulations, we observe the process of generalising morphological patterns in humans and two-layer connectionist networks. Replicating Bybee and Moder (1983), we find that people's willingness to generalise from existing irregular verbs to novel ones depends on the global similarity between them (e.g. spling is readily inflectable as splung, but nist is not inflectable as nust). In contrast, generalisability of the regular suffix does not appear to depend on similarity to existing regular verbs: Regularly suffixed versions of both common-sounding plip and odd-sounding ploamph were reliably produced and highly rated, and the odd-sounding verbs were not rated as having worse past-tense forms, relative to the naturalness of their stems, than common-sounding ones. In contrast, Rumelhart and McClelland's connectionist past-tense model was found to vary strongly in its tendency to supply both irregular and regular inflections to these novel items as a function of their similarity to forms it was trained on, and for the dissimilar forms, successful regular inflection rarely occurred. We suggest that rule-only theories have trouble explaining patterns of irregular generalisations, whereas single-network theories have trouble explaining regular ones; the computational demands of the two kinds of verbs are different, so a modular system is optimal for handling both simultaneously. Evidence from linguistics and psycholinguistics independently calls for such a hybrid, where irregular pairs are stored in a memory system that superimposes phonological forms, fostering generalisation by analogy, and regulars are generated by a default suffix concatenation process capable of operating on any verb, regardless of its sound.",266,FEB,1993,8,1,1,56,,10.1080/01690969308406948,1,1,one of several experiments is a replication,0,"Bybee, J.L. & Modcr, C.L.

They do, this, presumably, to indicate that a word is 'old' or 'Given', and that the existing representation of the referent can therefore be used to simplify and facilitate comprehension. The experiment reported here was designed to replicate and extend a previous study by Fowler. The experiment extended Fowler's work in two ways; first, into reference, by comparing word repetitions that involved 'new' as distinct from Given information and, second, into memory processes, by comparing discourse from normal and amnesic subjects. Following Fowler, the experiment demonstrated that word duration is reduced for repeated words when the second utterance involves Given or old information provided that the repetition occurs before a topic change, a pattern that was observed for both normal and amnesic subjects. However, unlike Fowler, the experiment demonstrated that word duration is increased for the second utterance when that utterance involves New information, a pattern that was also observed for both normal and amnesic subjects. The experiment demonstrated that referential information is preserved and used during spontaneous discourse by amnesic subjects. The measurement of duration by acoustic analysis therefore offers a new approach to the analysis of memory processes in conversation, and the results suggest that Given/New marking involves records that create or maintain specific information about reference and/or Given/New status.",3,APR,2000,15,2,203,222,,10.1080/016909600386093,1,1,replication of a previous study with extensions,0,"Fowler, C.A., & Housum, J.

Results revealed a cost in naming latencies when target and distractor take different determiner forms independent of whether or not they have the same gender. This replicates earlier results showing that congruency effects are due to competition during the selection of determiner forms rather than gender features. The overall pattern of results supports the view that grammatical feature selection is an automatic consequence of lexical node selection and therefore not subject to interference from incongruent grammatical features.

In Experiment 1, participants named picture primes and targets that were identical, shared the same onsets (e.g. coat-comb), or shared the same rhymes (e.g. mouse-house). In addition, the response stimulus interval (RSI) between the primes and targets was varied (650 and 1000 msec). The results revealed a facilitatory repetition priming effect that did not decrease with RSI. In addition, a reliable rhyme-related inhibitory effect was obtained, which was smaller in magnitude than the onset-related inhibitory effect. In Experiment 2, the identity condition was excluded to determine if a strategic comparison process may have produced the inhibitory effects. In addition, a new stimulus set was created and the RSI was held at 650 msec. The results replicated those of Experiment 1 by showing a reliably larger inhibitory effect for onset-related than rhyme-related targets.

Two experiments employed a character matching task to examine the contribution of radical position in Chinese character processing. The task was to decide whether the target character had appeared in two briefly and sequentially presented preceding source characters. Experiment 1 discovered significantly more false matching when the target (e. g., '(sic)') shared radicals with the source stimuli ('(sic)', '(sic)') than when the target and the source shared no radical, indicating that radicals contribute to character processing. Experiment 2 replicated this finding and further demonstrated that sharing a single radical between target and source characters, regardless of its radical position, was sufficient to generate false matching. More importantly, participants took significantly longer time to correctly reject those target characters with two shared radicals (one at the same position and another at the changed position) relative to those with only a single shared radical at the same position. Furthermore, false matching rates were significantly affected by lexical variables such as character frequency.

Native Spanish speakers comprehended spoken Spanish sentences with an embedded line drawing, which replaced a noun that either made sense or not with the preceding sentence context and either matched or mismatched the gender of the preceding article. In Experiment la (picture naming) slower naming times were found for gender mismatching pictures than matches, as well as for semantically incongruous pictures than congruous ones. In addition, the effects of gender agreement and semantic congruity interacted; specifically, pictures that were both semantically incongruous and gender mismatching were named slowest, but not as slow as if adding independent delays from both violations. Compared with a neutral baseline, with pictures embedded in simple command sentences like Now please say _, both facilitative and inhibitory effects were observed. Experiment 1b replicated these results with low-cloze gender-neutral sentences, more similar in structure and processing demands to the experimental sentences. In Experiment 2, participants judged a picture's semantic fit within a sentence by button-press; gender agreement and semantic congruity again interacted, with gender agreement having an effect on congruous but not incongruous pictures.

Results showed that colour identification is modulated by its congruency with the ASL sign, and this finding replicated irrespective of response mode - signing vs. button-press - and the presence of congruent trials.

"Lowder, Matthew W.; Gordon, Peter C.",Eye-tracking and corpus-based analyses of syntax-semantics interactions in complement coercion,LANGUAGE COGNITION AND NEUROSCIENCE,"Previous work has shown that the difficulty associated with processing complex semantic expressions is reduced when the critical constituents appear in separate clauses as opposed to when they appear together in the same clause. We investigated this effect further, focusing in particular on complement coercion, in which an event-selecting verb (e.g. began) combines with a complement that represents an entity (e.g. began the memo). Experiment 1 compared reading times for coercion versus control expressions when the critical verb and complement appeared together in a subject-extracted relative clause (SRC) (e.g. The secretary that began/wrote the memo) compared to when they appeared together in a simple sentence. Readers spent more time processing coercion expressions than control expressions, replicating the typical coercion cost. In addition, readers spent less time processing the verb and complement in SRCs than in simple sentences; however, the magnitude of the coercion cost did not depend on sentence structure. In contrast, Experiment 2 showed that the coercion cost was reduced when the complement appeared as the head of an object-extracted relative clause (ORC) (e.g. The memo that the secretary began/wrote) compared to when the constituents appeared together in an SRC. Consistent with the eye-tracking results of Experiment 2, a corpus analysis showed that expressions requiring complement coercion are more frequent when the constituents are separated by the clause boundary of an ORC compared to when they are embedded together within an SRC.

But how is the processing of typical disfluencies affected when the speaker also produces atypical disfluencies, as in the case of stuttering? We addressed this question in a visual-world eye-tracking experiment in which participants heard self-repair disfluencies while viewing displays that contained a predictable target entity. Half the participants heard the sentences spoken by a speaker who stuttered, and half heard the sentences spoken by the same speaker who produced the sentences without stuttering. Results replicated previous work in demonstrating that listeners engage in robust predictive processing when hearing self-repair disfluencies. Crucially, the magnitude of the prediction effect was reduced when the speaker stuttered compared to when the speaker did not stutter. Overall, the results suggest that listeners' ability to model the production system of a speaker is disrupted when the speaker stutters.",2,Jan.-02,2020,35,1,93,105,,10.1080/23273798.2019.1628284,1,1,replication of previous experiment by the same authors,1,"Lowder MW, & Ferreira F (2016b).

Four self-paced reading experiments investigated why this is the case. The experiments contrasted the hypothesis that the parser's behaviour is driven by the complexity or specificity of potential event structures with the hypothesis that what matters is simply the availability of multiple referents. First we replicated Patson & Ferreira's Experiment 1 with self-paced reading, and then in three studies we manipulated the conjuncts within a conjoined noun phrase (NP) subject (e. g. the men and the women vs. the man and the women) in order to vary event structures. The results indicated that potentially reciprocal verbs were interpreted as reciprocal with any conjoined subject, regardless of what type of NPs comprised it. This suggests that the parser is sensitive specifically to the presence of referents, not to the relative complexity or specificity of the event structure that could be built based on those referents.

Results are presented from an immediate serial recall (ISR) study, designed to determine the relative effects of L1 morphology and orthography on the recall of consonants versus vowels. Forty-five speakers of English, Amharic, and Arabic completed an ISR experiment testing the differential recall of these two segment types. English speakers remembered sequences of syllables in which the consonant is held constant and the vowel changes (e.g., ma mi mu.) better than sequences in which the vowel is held constant and the consonant changes (e.g., ka ma za.), whereas Arabic speakers remembered both types of sequences equally well, replicating findings from Kissling (2012). Crucially, Amharic speakers in this study performed similarly to Arabic speakers, remembering both sequence types with equal accuracy. Given that Amharic and Arabic share a templatic morphological system, this new result suggests that the morphophonology of a listener's L1 impacts ISR. English and Amharic share similar orthographic systems; the mean accuracies of English and Amharic speakers were significantly different, and it therefore appears that orthography of the L1 does not affect recall accuracy.

Detailed acoustic analyses indicated that the lab speech tune types were distinguishable by any of several independent F0 measures on the adjective and by F0 slope.

Intuitively, one would expect intonation to play only a small role in expressing communicative functions. However, experimental studies with Vietnamese native speakers show that intonation contours vary across different contexts and are used to mark certain types of information, for example, focus (Jannedy, 2007). In non-tonal languages (e.g., English), the marking of focus by intonation can influence the processing of focus alternatives (Fraundorf, Watson, & Benjamin, 2010). If Vietnamese also uses intonation to mark focus, the question arises whether the behavioral consequences of prosodic focus marking in Vietnamese are comparable to languages such as English or German. To test this, we replicate a study on memory for focus alternatives, originally carried out in German (Koch & Spalek, in progress), with Vietnamese language stimuli. In the original study, memory for focus alternatives was improved in a delayed recall task for focused elements produced with contrastive intonation in female speakers. Here, we replicate this finding with Northern Vietnamese native speakers: Contrastive intonation seems to improve later recall for focus alternatives in Northern Vietnamese, but only for female participants, in line with the findings by Koch and Spalek (in progress).

In Experiment 2, we explored the specificity of this effect by investigating how words semantically related to the mouth, but unrelated to vocalization (e.g., chewing) were articulated. Analyses revealed that mouth words did not differ from controls, and we replicated the vocal effects from Experiment 1, suggesting fine-grain motor activation from lexical semantics. Experiment 3 revealed that the semantics of a verb influences the prosodic intensity of a sentence prior to the onset of the verb. Together, these data suggest aspects of lexical meaning influence prosody, and that motor representations may underlie lexical semantics.",0,JUN,2016,8,2,314,334,,10.1017/langcog.2015.3,1,1,inner-paper replication,0,same,same,1,2016,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,conceptual,English,NA,0,,

In human communication, slow speech is considered boring, speech at normal speed is perceived as credible, and fast speech is perceived as competent. To seek the appropriate speech rate for robots, we test whether these tendencies are replicated in human-robot interaction by conducting an experiment with four rates of speech: fast, normal, moderately slow, and slow. Our experimental results reveal a rather surprising trend. Participants prefer normal and moderately slow speech to fast speech. A robot that provides normal or moderately slow speech is perceived as competent. We further study how context affects this perception. In a situation where the robot and participants talk while walking, we found that slow speech was the most comprehensible. In addition, slow speech is subjectively perceived as good as moderately slow and normal speech.",5,,2012,13,3,408,435,,10.1075/is.13.3.05kan,1,0,no clear communication of intent to replicate an original study,0,,,,,NA,,,,,,,NA,,NA,5,,

In addition to the primary task of comprehending speeches, participants make a secondary task light detection response. In the present experiment, the talker gave non-emotionally-expressive speeches that were used in past research with videotaped stimuli.

The first instruction established one cohort as discourse-given; the other was discourse-new. The second instruction was either fluent or disfluent, and referred to either the given or new cohort. Fluent instructions led to more initial fixations on the given cohort object (replicating Dahan et al., 2002). By contrast, disfluent instructions resulted in more fixations on the new cohort.

Experiments 1 (onsets) and 2 (rimes) used monosyllabic words. High- and low-frequency bigram letter clusters were primed. Primes turned out to be more effective when they coincided with the rimes of target words then when they did not. For onsets this was not the case. The effect of priming was stronger in low-frequency letter clusters. For rime units there was a significant prime by rime coincidence interaction, consistent with data presented by Bowey (1990). A differential effect of rime priming was obtained for the ability groups in high-frequency letter clusters. Only in the normal reader control group were response latencies negatively affected by noncoinciding primes in high-frequency rime units. This finding suggests that these subjects probably had better access to letter information in the final part of words. In Experiments 3 (onsets) and 4 (rimes) bisyllabic compound nouns were used. Elements of the second syllable were used as primes. Main group effects were found in both experiments, but the effects obtained with monosyllabic words were not replicated.

The less pronounced context effect evidenced in previous studies (e. g., Kaiser and Trueswell in Cognitioin 94: 113-147, 2004) might be due to the use of shorter target sentences and less extensive contexts. We also demonstrated that the slow-down starts at the first contextually inappropriate constituent, which shows that the information about context requirements is taken into account immediately, but that it develops faster on preverbal subjects and postverbal indirect objects (occupying their canonical positions) than on preverbal indirect objects (occupying a noncanonical position, or scrambled). In Experiment 2, these findings were replicated for IO S V DO and IO DO V S orders. S V IO DO orders with a continuation were used to show that there is no additional effect of inappropriate context at the end of the sentence.",13,AUG,2011,40,4,291,306,,10.1007/s10936-011-9171-5,1,1,inner-paper replication,1,same,same,1,2011,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,conceptual,Russian,NA,13,,

Pauses and other prosodic cues in spoken language serve the same function of structuring the sentence in smaller phrases, However, surprisingly little effort has been spent on the question as to whether both phenomena rest on the same mechanism and whether they are equally efficient in guiding parsing decisions. In a recent study, we showed that auditory speech boundaries evoke a specific positive shift in the listeners' event-related brain potentials (ERPs) that indicates the sentence segmentation and resulting changes in the understanding of the utterance (Steinhauer et al., 1999a). Here, ive present three ERP reading experiments demonstrating that the human brain processes commas in a similar manner and that comma perception depends crucially on the reader's individual punctuation habits. Main results of the study are: (1) Commas can determine initial parsing as efficiently as speech boundaries because they trigger the same prosodic phrasing covertly, although phonological representations seem to be activated to a lesser extent. (2) Independent of the input modality, this phrasing is reflected online by the same ERP component, namely the Closure Positive Shift (CPS). (3) Both behavioral and ERP data suggest that comma processing varies with the readers' idiosyncratic punctuation habits. (4) A combined auditory and visual ERP experiment shows that the CPS is also elicited both by delexicalized prosody and while subjects replicate prosodic boundaries during silent reading. (5) A comma-induced reversed garden path turned out to be much more difficult than the classical garden path.

Previous findings show that prominent features of meaning and sentence structure are placed to the left in drawings, according to reading direction (e.g. Stroustrup and Wallentin in Lang Cogn 10(2):193-207, 2018. 10.1017/langcog.2017.19). Five hundred thirty participants listened to sentences in Danish and made eight drawings each. We replicated three findings: (1) that the first mentioned element is placed to the left more often, (2) that the agent in the sentence is placed to the left, and (3) that the grammatical subject is placed to the left of the object. We further tested hypotheses related to deixis and gender stereotypes. By adding demonstratives (e.g. Danish equivalents of this and that), that have been found to indicate attentional prominence, we tested the hypothesis that this is also translated into a left-ward bias in the produced drawings. We were unable to find support for this hypothesis. Analyses of gender biases tested the presence of a gender identification and a gender stereotype effect. According to the identification hypothesis, participants should attribute prominence to their own gender and draw it to the left, and according to the stereotype effect participants should be more prone to draw the male character to the left, regardless of own gender. We were not able to find significant support for either of the two gender effects. The combination of replications and null-findings suggest that the left-ward bias in the drawing experiment might be narrowly tied to left-to-right distribution in written language and less to overall prominence.

Results of Experiment 1 revealed the PI group had significantly higher accuracy scores than the TI group. A change in eye-movement pattern was also observed after training for the PI group but not for the TI group.

Eye-movement patterns in Experiment 2 showed that both TI and PI started to shift their gaze to the correct picture at the same point as PI subjects did in Experiment 1.

Deictic judgments did not use the sagittal axis but sequential judgments did, in a previously undocumented way.

"Tieu, L.; Yatsushiro, K.; Cremers, A.; Romoli, J.; Sauerland, U.; Chemla, E.",On the Role of Alternatives in the Acquisition of Simple and Complex Disjunctions in French and Japanese,JOURNAL OF SEMANTICS,"When interpreting disjunctive sentences of the form 'A or B', young children have been reported to differ from adults in two ways. First, children have been reported to interpret disjunction inclusively rather than exclusively, accepting 'A or B' in contexts in which both A and B are true (Chierchia et al. 2001; Gualmini et al. 2001). Second, some children have been reported to interpret disjunction conjunctively, rejecting 'A or B' in contexts in which only one of the disjuncts is true (Paris 1973; Braine & Rumain 1981; Chierchia et al. 2004; Singh et al. 2015). In this article, we extend the investigation of children's interpretation of disjunction to include both simple and complex forms of disjunction, in two typologically unrelated languages: French and Japanese. First, given that complex disjunctions have been argued to give rise to obligatory exclusivity inferences (Spector 2014), we investigated whether the obligatoriness of the inference would play a role in the acquisition of the exclusive interpretation. Second, using a paradigm that makes the use of disjunction felicitous, we aimed to establish whether the finding of conjunctive interpretations would be replicated for both simple and complex forms of disjunction, and in languages other than English. The main findings from our experiment are that both French-and Japanese-speaking children interpreted the simple and complex disjunctions either inclusively or conjunctively; in contrast, adults generally accessed exclusive readings of both disjunctions. We argue that our results lend further support to the proposal put forth in Singh et al. (2015), according to which the reason some children compute conjunctive meanings while adults compute exclusivemeanings is that the two groups differ in their respective sets of alternatives for disjunction. Crucially, adults access conjunction as an alternative to disjunction, and compute exclusive interpretations; in contrast, children access only the individual disjuncts as alternatives, and therefore either interpret the disjunction literally or compute conjunctive inferences. More generally, our findings can be explained quite naturally within recent proposals according to which children differ from adults in the computation of scalar inferences because they are more restricted than adults in the set of scalar alternatives they can access (Barner et al. 2011; Tieu et al. 2015b, among others).",19,FEB,2017,34,1,127,152,,10.1093/jos/ffw010,1,0,no clear communication of intent to replicate an original study,0,,,,,NA,,,,,,,NA,,NA,19,,

In contrast, the so-called PHONO-TRANSLATION EFFECT (Hermans, Bongaerts, De Bot and Schreuder 1998) has been interpreted as revealing lexical competition across languages. In this article, we assess the reliability of these two effects by testing Spanish-Catalan highly-proficient bilinguals performing a Stroop task.

In the Just experiment, words with only one translation were recognized as translations faster than words with multiple translations. Furthermore, when words were presented with their dominant translation, the recognition process was faster than when words were presented with their non-dominant translation. In Experiment 2, these effects were replicated in both directions of translation (L1-L2 and L2-L1). In Experiment 3, we manipulated number-of-translations and the semantic relatedness between the different translations of a word. When the two translations of a word (i.e., bateau) were related in meaning (synonyms such as the English translations boat and ship), the translation recognition process was faster than when the two translations of a word (i.e., argent) were unrelated in meaning (the two translations money and silver). The consequences of translation ambiguities are discussed in the light oldie distributed conceptual feature model of bilingual memory (De Groot, 1992b; Hell and De Groot, 1998b).",27,APR,2010,13,2,157,183,,10.1017/S1366728909990472,1,0,no clear communication of intent to replicate an original study,0,,,,,NA,,,,,,,NA,,NA,27,,

Young children have difficulty in integrating multiple communicative cues when some of them have to be interpreted differently depending on other co-occurring cues. However, bilingual children, who regularly experience communicative challenges that demand greater attention and flexibility, may be more adept in integrating multiple cues to understand a speaker's communicative intent.

This study follows the research method of Sung (2010) which the author recorded his experiences as a 'purist' in Hong Kong: during a three-day experiment - the author employed only Cantonese, English and Putonghua, respectively. Field notes and reflective diaries were used to record the incidents of communication breakdowns resulted from the use of pure-code instead of mixed codes. Because of the recent change in language policy in which Putonghua has placed more important roles in language teaching in Hong Kong, Putonghua has been added into the current study intentionally because Sung (2010) only included Cantonese and English, which largely ignored the fact the Putonghua has become an important part in the linguistic environment of Hong Kong. The difficulties of using only pure-Cantonese, pure-English and pure-Putonghua in Hong Kong will be discussed. Also, I suggest that there exists the code-switching among Cantonese, English and Putonghua in Hong Kong because of the increasing contact with China and the new policy of using Putonghua as the Medium of Instruction (PMI) in some primary schools. Moreover, the present study suggests that the use of pure-code in these languages may hinder communication in Hong Kong. Further studies are needed on code-switching among the three languages within the younger generation of Hongkongers, especially those who attend PMI schools.",2,SPR,2018,35,1,75,95,,10.17250/khisli.35.1.201803.003,0,1,replication in a different language,1,"Sung, Chit Cheung Matthew. 2010.

L2ers' predictions of syntactic structure and reaction Wiles during sentence processing. Linguistic Research 37(Special Edition): 189-218. This paper investigates how Korean 12 learners of English predict upcoming syntactic structure based on a newly received word during sentence processing. Studies like Linzen and Jaeger (2016) suggest that readers use their probabilistic inference developed by their experience of the language to which they have been exposed to predict the most appropriate syntactic structure. This study replicates the experiment for L2ers following Linzen and Jaeger (ibid.), which investigates the way of predicting syntactic structure by using the subcategorization frame of a verb to understand L1 language processing. We employ the information-complexity metrics such as surprisal, entropy, and entropy reduction to quantify the uncertainty/unexpectedness of a given word that reflects the processing difficulty during sentence processing. The results show that L2ers' tendency to read different regions of a sentence varies. Reading times are longer in the verb and the ambiguous regions of the structurally ambiguous than of the structurally unambiguous sentences. Likewise, reading times are longer in the disambiguating region of the unambiguous than of the ambiguous sentences. Reading firms are also longer when the surprisal increases in the disambiguating region. Overall, the findings reveal that such information-complexity metrics as entropy reduction and surprisal play an instrumental role in accounting for the aspects of sentence processing by Korean 12 learners of English.

In this paper, we examine the effect of L1 orthography on non-native sound perception. In Experiment 1, 204 Spanish learners of Dutch and a control group of 20 native speakers of Dutch were asked to classify Dutch vowel tokens by choosing from auditorily presented options, in one task, and from the orthographic representations of Dutch vowels, in a second task. The results show that vowel categorization varied across tasks: the most difficult vowels in the purely auditory task were the easiest in the orthographic task and, conversely, vowels with a relatively high success rate in the purely auditory task were poorly classified in the orthographic task. The results of Experiment 2 with 22 monolingual Peruvian Spanish listeners replicated the main results of Experiment 1 and confirmed the existence of orthographic effects. Together, the two experiments show that when listening to auditory stimuli only, native speakers of Spanish have great difficulty classifying certain Dutch vowels, regardless of the amount of experience they may have with the Dutch language. Importantly, the pairing of auditory stimuli with orthographic labels can help or hinder Spanish listeners' sound categorization, depending on the specific sound contrast.",59,SEP,2010,53,,343,365,,10.1177/0023830910371447,1,0,no clear communication of intent to replicate an original study,0,,,,,NA,,,,,,,NA,,NA,59,,

Our study replicates and extends Dupoux, Kakehi, Hirose, Pallier, & Mehler's (1999) results that suggested that listeners perceive epenthetic vowels within consonantal sequences that violate the phonotactics of their L1. Korean employs at least two kinds of phonotactic restrictions: (i) syllable structure restrictions that prohibit the occurence of certain consonants in coda position (e.g., *[c.], *[g.]), while allowing others (e.g., [k.], [1.]), and (ii) consonantal contact restrictions that ban the co-occurrence of certain heterosyllabic consonants (e.g., *[k.m]; *[l.n]) due to various phonological processes that repair such sequences on the surface (i.e., /k.m/ -> [n.m]; /l.n/ -> [1.1]). The results suggest that Korean syllable structure restrictions, rather than consonantal contact restrictions, result in the perception of epenthetic vowels. Furthermore, the frequency of co-occurrence fails to explain the epenthesis effects in the percept of consonant clusters employed in the present study. We address questions regarding the interaction between speech perception and phonology and test the validity of Steriade's (2001 a,b) Perceptual-Mapping (P-Map) hypothesis for the Korean sonorant assimilation processes.

This knowledge generalized to novel variant forms.

Similarity to a high-frequency variant alone, however, was insufficient to explain recognition of the infrequent variants (Experiments 4 and 5).

TEs are defined as less accurate and slower responses to transposed-nonwords (e.g., < psate(sic), formed from base-word < paste(sic)) than corresponding replaced-nonwords (e.g., < pzute(sic)). In Hindi's orthography, letters map transparently to phonemes (except schwa), but the letters are arranged into akshars, (<[C-n]V(sic)) which encode open syllables. This formal characteristic makes Hindi's orthography typologically aksharic. We used TEs to determine whether the orthography's typological units, letters and akshars, are also functional units for readers. We conducted three visual word recognition experiments with adult readers whose native language was Hindi. In Experiment 1, we found TEs for consonant (< C(sic)) and matra (< M(sic), a vowel diacritic) letters, using different stimulus sets for each type of transposition. In the next two experiments, we used the same base words to form all of the transposed and replaced items. In Experiment 2, we replicated the findings of Experiment 1 in a different stimulus set; additionally, we found TEs for transpositions between a < C(sic) letter and a < CM(sic) akshar. In Experiment 3, we replicated results of the first two experiments by finding TEs for both consonants and matras in another stimulus set; additionally, we found similar TEs for < CM(sic) akshars. These results show that < C(sic) and < M(sic) letters are functional units for Hindi readers; the transposition results for < CM(sic) akshars are tentative.

"Stevenson, RJ; Nelson, AWR; Stenning, K",The role of parallelism in strategics of pronoun comprehension,LANGUAGE AND SPEECH,"Two experiments investigated the role of parallelism in strategies of pronoun assignment and tested the proposition that a parallel function strategy and the subject assignment strategy jointly contribute to the interpretation of pronouns. The parallel function strategy interprets a pronoun as coreferential with a preceding noun phrase in the same grammatical role, while the subject assignment strategy interprets a pronoun as coreferential with a preceding subject noun phrase. The results of Experiment 1 showed that the subject assignment and parallel function strategies jointly constrained assignment. When both strategies yielded the same interpretation, as was the case for subject assignments with subject pronouns, subject assignment preferences were greater than when only the subject assignment strategy was available, as was the case with nonsubject pronouns in partially parallel sentences (i.e., sentences in which the pronoun and antecedent differed grammatically). When the two strategies yielded conflicting assignments, as was the case with nonsubject pronouns in fully parallel sentences, subject assignments were reduced even further and nonsubject assignments were preferred. Experiment 2 replicated the results of Experiment 1 in isolated sentences rather than in short texts and ruled out the idea that a third ''parallel order'' strategy might be used in partially parallel sentences. We suggest that the subject assignment strategy reflects the topic status of the subject noun phrase, while parallel function reflects the use of correspondences between sentence structures in comprehension. We also suggest that the joint operation of heuristic strategies implies a model of discourse processing in which a number of constraints compete in the interpretation of noun phrases.",24,OCT-DEC,1995,38,,393,418,,10.1177/002383099503800404,1,0,no clear communication of intent to replicate an original study,0,,,,,NA,,,,,,,NA,,NA,24,,

In Experiment 1, subjects judged the meaningfulness of full sentences. The frequency with which verbs are used transitively determined whether there was an effect of the plausibility of the WH-phrase to act as an object of the verb. Effects of plausibility of the WH-phrase as an object showed up in just those cases where the object role should be assigned to the WH-phrase according to the Lexical Expectation model, rather than as predicted by the All Resorts model. In Experiment 2, these results were replicated using the word-by-word self-paced reading paradigm. The plausibility effect showed up at the verb itself when it is normally used transitively.

Our first experiment, using their procedure, only partially replicated their results. Low vowels showed a higher F I, consistent with hyperspace. Front vowels also showed more frontness in F2, but back vowels were less extreme (hypoarticulated) on F2. Our second experiment used an identification and rating of each stimulus, yielding similar results of a smaller magnitude. Our results indicate that the perceptual space is calibrated to a particular (synthetic) vowel space, which is not related straightforwardly to the speakers' spaces. The original hyperspace hypothesis can be attributed to the methodology which led to extreme judgments and of the fronting of back vowels in California English. The present results indicate that no such hypothesis is needed.

A conceptual replication study on visual attention and immersion,JOURNAL OF SPECIALISED TRANSLATION,"In an eye-tracking study, Romero-Fresco (2016) discovered that when watching a dubbed film, Spanish viewers hardly looked at characters' mouths and focussed instead on their eyes - a phenomenon he termed 'the dubbing effect'. Our study is a conceptual replication of Romero-Fresco's study, aimed at answering the question of whether a similar effect also takes place in voice-over: do viewers avoid looking at characters' mouths to stay immersed in the film story? With this question in mind, we tested 35 Polish native speakers watching a 6-minute voiced-over excerpt from Casablanca while their eyes were monitored with an eye tracker. We also measured viewers' immersion levels as well as their enjoyment and comprehension. In this paper, we present two experiments. In Experiment 1, by analysing viewers' gaze behaviour and immersion levels, we found that Polish viewers did not avoid looking at characters' mouths. In Experiment 2, we compared our results with those obtained in the original study with Spanish and English viewers. We found that visual attention distribution in Polish voice-over resembled the one observed in English viewers, who watched the film with the original soundtrack.

This growing body of research has explored several aspects of AVT reception and production using behavioural measures such as eye tracking, as well as venturing into physiological measures such as electroencephalography (EEG), galvanic skin response, and heart rate. As a novel approach to the field of AVT, the experimental approach has borrowed heavily from other fields with established experimental traditions, such as psycholinguistics, psychology, and cognitive science. However, these methodologies are often not implemented with the same rigour as in the disciplines from which they were taken, making for highly eclectic and, at times, inconsistent practices. The absence of a common framework and best practice for experimental research in AVT poses significant risk in addition to the potential reputational damage. Some of the most important risks are: the duplication of efforts, studies that cannot be replicated due to a lack of methodological standardisation and rigour, and findings that are, at best, impossible to generalise from and, at worst, invalid. Given the growing body of work in AVT taking a quasi-experimental approach, it is time to consolidate our position and establish a common framework in order to ensure the integrity of our endeavours. This chapter analyses problems and discusses solutions specifically related to the multidisciplinary nature of experimental AVT research. In so doing, it aims to set the course for future experimental research in AVT, in order to gain credibility in the wider scientific community and contributes new insights to the fields from which AVT has been borrowing.

Lai (2015) provided the initial laboratory support for this hypothesis. The current study aimed to replicate and extend the earlier findings by using a different experimental paradigm (oddball task) and a different measure of learning (sensitivity index, d'). Specifically, we compared the learnability of two phonotactic patterns that differ computationally and typologically: a simple rule (First-Last Assimilation) that requires agreement between the first and last segment of a word (predicted to be unlearnable), and a harmony rule (Sibilant Harmony) that requires the agreement of features throughout the word (predicted to be learnable). The First-Last Assimilation rule was tested under two experimental conditions: one where the training data were also consistent with the Sibilant Harmony rule, and one where the training data were only consistent with the First-Last rule. As in Lai (2015), we found that participants were significantly more sensitive to violations of the Sibilant Harmony (SH) rule than to the First-Last Assimilation (FL) rules. However, unlike Lai (2015), we also found that participants showed some residual sensitivity to the First-Last rule, but that sensitivity interacted with rule type so that participants were significantly more sensitive to SH rule violations.

Sentences contained a determiner phrase (DP) that functioned as the grammatical subject and a DP that functioned as the direct, indirect or prepositional object. The pronoun was either contained in the direct object DP or a prepositional object DP. In half of the sentences, pronouns could only be interpreted as bound by the subject DP. In the other half of sentences, they could only be interpreted as bound by the object DR Results from Experiment 1 reveal similar reading times for DPros and PPros when they were bound by the object DP, and significantly longer reading times for DPros than PPros when they were bound by the subject DP. Experiment 2 replicated the DPro effect from Experiment 1 with materials where potential subject and object binders were quantifiers. Finally, Experiment 3 shows that also in the context of quantifier binding DPros are not generally dispreferred. Sentences with a DPro were only rated as less acceptable than sentences with a PPro when the potential binder was the subject.

Recent large-scale replication studies conducted in response to this criticism have shown that the majority of published English acceptability judgments are robust. We make two observations about these replication studies. First we raise the concern that English acceptability judgments may be more reliable than judgments in other languages. Second, we argue that it is unnecessary to replicate judgments that illustrate uncontroversial descriptive facts; rather, candidates for replication can emerge during formal or informal peer review. We present two experiments motivated by these arguments. Published Hebrew and Japanese acceptability contrasts considered questionable by the authors of the present paper were rated for acceptability by a large sample of naive participants. Approximately half of the contrasts did not replicate. We suggest that the reliability of acceptability judgments, especially in languages other than English, can be improved using a simple open review system, and that formal experiments are only necessary in controversial cases.",9,Sept.-13,2018,3,1,,,100,10.5334/gjgl.528,0,0,review; meta-level,1,,,,,NA,,,,,,,NA,,NA,9,,

At test, participants performed free recall and yes/no recognition tasks. Replicating previous work in this paradigm, results showed robust false memory effects: that is, participants were more likely to (falsely) remember a critical item than a random intrusion. When the realization of /s/ was consistent across conditions (Experiment 1), false memory rates for varying versus non-varying words did not significantly differ. However, when the realization of /s/ varied between [s] and [h] in those positions which allow it (Experiment 2), false recognition rates for varying words like busto were significantly higher than those for non-varying words like sopa.

Plural marking has also been observed to occur on mass nouns in Greek and a few other languages, giving rise to a parallel abundance inference, indicating that there is a lot of the relevant substance. It has been observed in the literature that both of these inferences disappear in downward-entailing environments, such as when a plural appears in the scope of negation (Tsoulas 2009; Kane et al. 2015). There are two main competing approaches in the literature that aim to account for the described pattern with respect to multiplicity inferences: the ambiguity approach (Farkas & de Swart 2010) and the implicature approach (Sauerland 2003; Spector 2007; Mayr 2015, among others). As discussed in Tieu et al. (2018), while both approaches can account for the upward-versus downward-entailing pattern of multiplicity inferences, they differ in what they predict with respect to the acquisition of these inferences and their relationship with implicatures. lieu et al. (2014; 2018) investigated multiplicity inferences in English and reported evidence for the implicature approach. In this paper, we first show how the ambiguity approach and the implicature approach to the multiplicity inference can be extended to account for the abundance inference. We then report on an experiment that tests the predictions of the two approaches for multiplicity and abundance inferences in preschool-aged children and adult native speakers of Greek. Our results replicate the patterns reported in Tieu et al. (2014; 2018) for multiplicity inferences, and crucially reveal an analogous pattern for abundance inferences. Adults computed both kinds of inferences more in upward-entailing environments than in downward-entailing ones, and children computed fewer inferences overall than adults did. These results reflect an overall pattern of implicature calculation in line with a unified implicature analysis across the three kinds of inferences. By contrast, we discuss how they pose a challenge for the ambiguity approach.",2,OCT 3,2018,3,1,,,103,10.5334/gjgl.531,1,0,no clear communication of intent to replicate an original study,1,,,,,NA,,,,,,,NA,,NA,2,,

We have presented elsewhere evidence for analyzing these accents as consisting of a L(ow) and a H(igh) target. In a first experiment exploring the factors that affect the location of the H target, we discovered that in words with antepenultimate lexical stress the H is consistently aligned just after the onset of the first postaccentual vowel. In a second experiment we replicated this finding, showing that the alignment of the H is not affected by variations in the duration of the accented syllable. A third experiment showed that for some speakers the alignment of the H may be affected by tonal crowding, when the accented syllable is close to the end of the word and/or close to the next accent. Overall, however, the results show that the L and H targets are independently aligned relative to the segmental string: the accentual rise is neither of fixed slope nor of fixed duration.

Our replication of de Boer's simulations confirmed the peak in the F2 range function when 'the vertical and horizontal parts of the tract are approximately equally long.

We report five experiments in which participants were tested on the recognition of reduced words originating from a corpus of conversational Dutch. Experiment 1, a visual doze test, demonstrates that our set of reduced words cannot be guessed just on the basis of their semantic/syntactic context. Experiment 2 replicates the earlier finding that reduced words can only be recognised in their contexts. Experiment 3 shows that the reduced words were less well recognised if the context is presented visually in the form of orthographic transcriptions. These experiments suggest that listeners need some acoustic properties of reduced words themselves, together with semantic/syntactic and acoustic information in their contexts, to recognise reduced words. Experiments 4 and 5 confirm the importance of acoustic information for word recognition by showing that high-frequency hearing loss hinders both the interpretation of the target words' acoustic properties, and the use of neighbouring context.

"Johnson, K; Strand, EA; D'Imperio, M",Auditory-visual integration of talker gender in vowel perception,JOURNAL OF PHONETICS,"The experiments reported here used auditory-visual mismatches to compare three approaches to speaker normalization in speech perception: radical invariance, vocal tract normalization, and talker normalization. In contrast to the first two, the talker normalization theory assumes that listeners' subjective, abstract impressions of talkers play a role in speech perception. Experiment 1 found that the gender of a visually presented face affects the location of the phoneme boundary between [upsilon] and [Lambda] in the perceptual identification of a continuum of auditory-visual stimuli ranging from hood to hud. This effect was found for both stereotypical and non-stereotypical'' male and female voices. The experiment also found that voice stereotypicality had an effect on the phoneme boundary. The difference between male and female talkers was greater when the talkers were rated by listeners as stereotypical. Interestingly, for the two female talkers in this experiment, rated stereotypicality was correlated with voice breathiness rather than vowel fundamental frequency. Experiment 2 replicated and extended experiment 1 and tested whether the visual stimuli in experiment 1 were being perceptually integrated with the acoustic stimuli. In addition to the effects found in experiment 1, there was a boundary effect for the visually presented word: listeners responded hood more frequently when the acoustic stimulus was paired with a movie clip of a talker saying hood. Experiment 3 tested the abstractness of the talker information used in speech perception. Rather than seeing movie clips of male and female talkers, listeners were instructed to imagine a male or female talker while performing an audio-only identification task with a gender-ambiguous hood-hud continuum. The phoneme boundary differed as a function of the imagined gender of the talker. The results from these experiments suggest that listeners integrate abstract gender information with phonetic information in speech perception. This conclusion supports the talker normalization theory of perceptual speaker normalization.

"Kirby, James; Sonderegger, Morgan",Mixed-effects design analysis for experimental phonetics,JOURNAL OF PHONETICS,"It is common practice in the statistical analysis of phonetic data to draw conclusions on the basis of statistical significance. While p-values reflect the probability of incorrectly concluding a null effect is real, they do not provide information about other types of error that are also important for interpreting statistical results. In this paper, we focus on three measures related to these errors. The first, power, reflects the likelihood of detecting an effect that in fact exists. The second and third, Type M and Type S errors, measure the extent to which estimates of the magnitude and direction of an effect are inaccurate. We then provide an example of design analysis (Gelman & Carlin, 2014), using data from an experimental study on German incomplete neutralization, to illustrate how power, magnitude, and sign errors vary with sample and effect size. This case study shows how the informativity of research findings can vary substantially in ways that are not always, or even usually, apparent on the basis of a p-value alone. We conclude by repeating three recommendations for good statistical practice in phonetics from best practices widely recommended for the social and behavioral sciences: report all results; design studies which will produce high-precision estimates; and conduct direct replications of previous findings.

Experiment 2, with different 16 American English speakers, collected tight-tide judgments of a synthetic stimulus in which offglide F-1, offglide F-2, and nuclear duration were varied independently.

"Reinisch, Eva; Mitterer, Holger","Exposure modality, input variability and the categories of perceptual recalibration",JOURNAL OF PHONETICS,"Recent evidence shows that studies on perceptual recalibration and its generalization can inform us about the presence and nature of prelexical units used for speech perception. Listeners recalibrate perception when hearing an ambiguous auditory stimulus between, for example, /p/ and /t/ in unambiguous lexical context (kee[p/T]>/p/, mee[p/t]->/t/) or visual context (presence vs. absence of lip closure). A later encountered ambiguous auditory only stimulus is then perceived in line with the previously experienced context. Unlike studies using lexical context to guide learning, experiments with the visual paradigm suggested that prelexical units are rather specific and context-dependent. However, these experiments raised doubts whether lexically-guided and visually-guided recalibration are targeting the same type of units, or whether learning in the visually-guided paradigm with limited variability during exposure is task-specific. The present study shows successful visually-guided learning following exposure to a variety of different learning trials. We also show that patterns of generalization found with the visually-guided paradigm can be replicated with a lexically-guided paradigm: listeners do not generalize a recalibrated stop contrast across manner of articulation. This supports suggestions that the units of perception depend on the distribution of relevant cues in the speech signal. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

B.; Winter, B.; Grawunder, S.; Kirby, J.; Grice, M.",Assessing incomplete neutralization of final devoicing in German,JOURNAL OF PHONETICS,"It has been claimed that the long established neutralization of the voicing distinction in domain final position in German is phonetically incomplete. However, many studies that have advanced this claim have subsequently been criticized on methodological grounds, calling incomplete neutralization into question. In three production experiments and one perception experiment we address these methodological criticisms. In the first production study, we address the role of orthography. In a large scale auditory task using pseudowords, we confirm that neutralization is indeed incomplete and suggest that previous null results may simply be due to lack of statistical power. In two follow-up production studies (Experiments 2 and 3), we rule out a potential confound of Experiment 1, namely that the effect might be due to accommodation to the presented auditory stimuli, by manipulating the duration of the preceding vowel. While the between-items design (Experiment 2) replicated the findings of Experiment 1, the between-subjects version (Experiment 3) failed to find a statistically significant incomplete neutralization effect, although we found numerical tendencies in the expected direction. Finally, in a perception study (Experiment 4), we demonstrate that the subphonemic differences between final voiceless and devoiced stops are audible, but only barely so. Even though the present findings provide evidence for the robustness of incomplete neutralization in German, the small effect sizes highlight the challenges of investigating this phenomenon. We argue that without necessarily postulating functional relevance, incomplete neutralization can be accounted for by recent models of lexical organization. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

"Shosted, Ryan K.",An articulatory-aerodynamic approach to stop excrescence,JOURNAL OF PHONETICS,"The distinction between underlying and excrescent stops in pairs like 'mints' and 'mince' was convincingly demonstrated by Fourakis and Port (1986). Several subsequent studies have been unable to replicate the result for speakers of American English, or have done so only partially. These studies have largely dealt with the acoustic signal. This study presents an approach to stop excrescence that refers to both the aerodynamics and articulation of the phenomenon. The results confirm and expand on the original findings. Using nasal flow as an indirect measure of velopharyngeal aperture and electropalatography (EPG) to estimate the moment of oral release, the presence of occlusion, as well as the duration of nasal and oral occlusion were measured. Overall contact across the palate was also measured. Disyllabic and monosyllabic tokens with /ns/ and /nts/ in final position were pronounced by four male speakers of American English. Disyllabic tokens could be either stressed or unstressed on the final syllable. In Experiment I, speakers produced tokens in a standard carrier phrase; in Experiment II, they produced one of the items in contrastive focus to its 'homophonous' counterpart, e.g., 'I said mince not mints'. Underlying stops were significantly longer than excrescent stops, including in the contrastive-focus condition. A trading relation between nasal and oral stop duration was demonstrated when the stop was excrescent, but not when it was underlying. This suggests that the nasal-oral occlusion in epenethetic stops is divided proportionally between the underlying nasal and excrescent oral stop, but that the durations of the nasal and underlying oral stops are independent.

The current experiment, investigating the position of p-centres in Czech, aims to replicate the findings from English and several other languages, and substantially increase the range of phonotactic types and the number of participants. In a speech-metronome synchronization task, 24 subjects pronounced a set of 37 natural disyllabic Czech words of differing complexity at two metronome rates. The beginning of the first vowel (V1) and the moment of the fastest increase in energy within the first syllable were the most consistent synchronization points, but the p-centre occurred earlier than at the V1 initial boundary. Synchronization intervals were significantly influenced by the complexity of the syllabic onset: the p-centre was positioned earlier (further from the V1) as more consonants were included in the onset. The effects of vowel length and final coda were also present, but weaker. In addition, various aspects of human musicality were found to correlate with the ability of speakers to synchronize their articulations with an isochronous auditory sequence. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

However, in group studies, treatment was underspecified and replication was impossible. In single case studies, treatment was clearly defined and experimentally controlled but its scope was generally limited, e.g. learning of a pre-determined and relatively low number of words or reading of irregular words. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of an intensive (4-5 h/day), clearly defined, and model-based treatment in a subject-DA-with multiple language disorders who was beyond the period of spontaneous recovery. DA underwent a general neuropsychological and language evaluation 8 months post-onset. He had moderate comprehension disorders, reading and writing were slow and severely damaged, and his speech was agrammatic. DA's spontaneous production was analysed according to the Quantitative Production Analysis (QPA) method. Treatment lasted 8 months and was directed at each functional impairment. Results at the first and the final evaluation were compared. Important differences were found in many language tasks and in spontaneous production, showing that intensive and model-based treatment can improve the patient's daily use of language, even in a chronic subject past the period of spontaneous recovery.

The deficit has therefore been attributed to damage in nonlexical phonological processing.

The generality of this claim is examined by replicating the Buchanan et al. experiments with two other deep dyslexic patients. Dissociations between Lexical and nonlexical processing are examined by manipulating nonword phonology in a task that does not require lexical analysis.

Tone sandhi is commonly present in East Asian languages. An example from Mandarin is the Tone tone 3 sandhi rule: T3 is pronounced as T2 when followed by another T3 (33 -> 23). Previous mismatch negativity (MMN) studies in Mandarin have reported a smaller amplitude or longer latency in standard-deviant pair consisting of T2 and T3 (T2-T3) than in Tl-T3. The most widely accepted explanation for this is that T2 and T3 have steeper pitch slopes than Tl. This study tested an alternative account based on the phonological rule that the frequent substitution that occurs between T2 and T3 results in reduced MMN. In Experiment 1, we first tried to replicate the finding in Mandarin. In Experiment 2, using both unskilled and skilled speakers, we tested a sandhi tone pair of very different pitch slopes in Taiwanese. Delayed peak latency of sandhi pair was evident in both languages but only in skilled speakers. Our results did not support the shared-pitch-slope account and were instead consistent with the argument that a language-specific phonological rule could modulate preattentive tone processing.",0,AUG,2019,51,,63,75,,10.1016/j.jneuroling.2019.01.001,1,0,no clear communication of intent to replicate an original study,0,,,,,NA,,,,,,,NA,,NA,0,,
"Dwivedi, Veena D.; Gibson, Raechelle M.",An ERP investigation of quantifier scope ambiguous sentences: Evidence for number in events,JOURNAL OF NEUROLINGUISTICS,"We used event related potentials (ERPs) in order to investigate how sentences, semantically ambiguous with respect to number, are understood. Although sentences such as (i) Every kid climbed a tree lack any syntactic or lexical ambiguity, two possible meanings are available, where either many trees or just one tree was climbed. Previous behavioural studies showed a plural preference, whereas ERP and behavioural experiments conducted in our lab have not. In this work, we further investigate sentences as in (i), called quantifier scope ambiguous sentences, and compare them to unambiguous sentences, (ii) Every kid climbed the trees. Participants read sentences presented in 1- and 2-word chunks, and judged, at the target word tree(s), whether 1 or 2 words appeared on the computer screen (Berent et al., 2005). Previously, interference effects resulted for judgments that 1 word was on the screen when it was marked plural (e.g., trees) versus singular (e.g., tree). Interestingly, Patson and Warren (2010) also showed that this was the case for judgments made for singular words, e.g., tree, in quantifier ambiguous sentences, confirming the plural preference. The current ERP study did not replicate their behavioural findings. Difficulty for 1 responses was not observed for trees in (ii) nor was it observed for tree in quantifier scope sentences (i). Instead, a P300 effect was found at the target word tree(s), where amplitudes differed depending on congruency in number interpretation for subjects and direct objects. Results are discussed in terms of heuristic first sentence processing mechanisms, and relevant features of event knowledge. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

"Fraga, Isabel; Padron, Isabel; Acuna-Farina, Carlos; Diaz-Lago, Marcos",Processing gender agreement and word emotionality: New electrophysiological and behavioural evidence,JOURNAL OF NEUROLINGUISTICS,"The present article reports an ERP study with two experiments designed to assess the influence of emotional adjectives on sentence processing by means of a gender agreement (grammaticality) judgment task. Participants were shown transitive sentences in Spanish presented word-by-word, with a complex object-NP consisting of a noun + an adjective + some additional material. ERPs were recorded at the critical adjectives, which could be either emotionally unpleasant, neutral, or pleasant, and could either agree (match) or fail to agree (mismatch) in gender with the modified noun. Results replicate the typical ERP signatures of morphosyntactic errors. Specifically, larger amplitudes for LAN and P600 components were found in sentences with a gender mismatch in both experiments. However, ERP components did not show any differences between emotional and neutral adjectives in these sentences. Only in Experiment 2 was a significant interaction found between grammaticality and emotionality. Thus, in the 500-700 ms window larger amplitudes emerged for neutral words than for emotional words in match sentences. Likewise, a significant interaction between grammaticality and emotionality in the participants' performance revealed that the presence, of emotional adjectives did facilitate the detection of gender errors. Overall, these results show that during sentence reading syntactic error detection seems to occur in an encapsulated manner, although performance may indeed be facilitated by the presence of emotional words.

In Experiment 1, 37 first language (L1) English speakers varying in second language (L2, French) proficiency made living/non-living judgments to English and French nouns in lists blocked by language. Sixty critical words were each presented twice, once primed by a semantic associate in the preceding trial (e.g. ADULT, CHILD) and once unprimed (e.g. RABBIT, CHILD). Measures of response time (RT) and intra-individual variability in response time (coefficient of variation, CV) were obtained. The CV provided an index of processing efficiency that has been related to automaticity. Participants performed faster and with lower CVs (i.e. with greater efficiency) in L1 than L2, and the more highly proficient bilinguals had lower CVs than the less proficient bilinguals. Experiment 2 replicated these results with 29 participants and provided an electrical brain activity measure of processing efficiency using the N400 ERP. The similar pattern of results obtained between the behavioural and N400 ERP CV measures supported the idea that the CV measure of electrical brain activity can provide useful information about the automaticity or efficiency of cognitive processing.

I.",Interference from object part relations in spoken word production: Behavioural and fMRI evidence,JOURNAL OF NEUROLINGUISTICS,"Objects presented in categorically related contexts are typically named slower than objects presented in unrelated contexts, a phenomenon termed semantic interference. However, not all semantic relationships induce interference. In the present study, we investigated the influence of object part-relations in the blocked cyclic naming paradigm. In Experiment 1 we established that an object's parts do induce a semantic interference effect when named in context compared to unrelated parts (e.g., leaf, root, nut, bark; for tree). In Experiment 2) we replicated the effect during perfusion functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to identify the cerebral regions involved. The interference effect was associated with significant perfusion signal increases in the hippocampal formation and decreases in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. We failed to observe significant perfusion signal changes in the left lateral temporal lobe, a region that shows reliable activity for interference effects induced by categorical relations in the same paradigm and is proposed to mediate lexical-semantic processing. We interpret these results as supporting recent explanations of semantic interference in blocked cyclic naming that implicate working memory mechanisms. However, given the failure to observe significant perfusion signal changes in the left temporal lobe, the results provide only partial support for accounts that assume semantic interference in this paradigm arises solely due to lexical-level processes.

In an ERP study (Experiment 1), we make use of the negation sensitivity of negative polarity items (NPIs) and examine the time course of processing different kinds of negation. Four kinds of NPI-licensing environments were examined: the negative determiner no, the negative determiner few, the focus marker only, and emotive predicates (e.g., surprised). While the first three contribute a negative meaning via semantic assertion (explicit negation), the last gives rise to a pragmatic negative inference via non-asserted content (implicit negation). Under all these environments, an NPI elicited a smaller N400 compared to an unlicensed NPI, suggesting that negation, regardless of its source, is rapidly computed online. However, we also observed that explicit negative meaning (i.e., semantic, as contributed in the assertion) and implicit negative meaning (contributed by pragmatic inferences) were integrated into the grammatical representation in different ways, leading to a difference in the P600, and calling for a separation of semantic and pragmatic integration during sentence processing (and NPI licensing). The qualitative differences between these conditions were also replicated in a self-paced reading study (Experiment 2). (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Routinely cited as support for this idea are experiments by Craik and Tulving (C&T) demonstrating superior recognition and recall of studied words following semantic tasks (deep encoding) compared to structure-related tasks (shallow encoding). However, participants in C&T were not language learners but native speakers of English studying known English nouns. These experiments have never been directly replicated using nonnatives to establish the relevance of the findings to nonnatives and learners. The present study replicated C&T Experiment 5, comparing effects of shallow and deep encoding tasks on subsequent recognition of target words by native and nonnative speakers of English with equivalent short-term memory function. The results showed depth effects similar to C&T for all participants, indicating that C&T's results do generalize to less proficient speakers of the target language. It is crucial, however, that nonnative speakers of English benefited less from semantic encoding than native speakers, suggesting an effect of preexisting knowledge representations on mnemonic effects derived from semantic processing, and hence, a limit to the relevance of C&T for learners.

"Byrne, B",The learnability of the alphabetic principle: Children's initial hypotheses about how print represents spoken language,APPLIED PSYCHOLINGUISTICS,"This research examines the hypotheses about how print represents the speech that preliterate children select when they receive input compatible with several such hypotheses. In Experiment 1, preschoolers were taught to read hat and hats and book and books. Then, in generalization tests, they were probed for what they had learned about the letter s. All of the children were able to transfer to other plurals (e.g., to decide that bikes said ''bikes'' rather than ''bike,'' and that dog said ''dog'' and not ''dogs''), but only those who knew the sound of the letter s prior to the experiment were able to decide, for example, that bus said ''bus'' and not ''bug.'' The failure to detect the phonemic value of s on the part of alphabetically naive children was replicated in Experiments 2, 3, and 4, which instituted a variety of controls. In Experiment 5, it was found that, although preschoolers who had been taught to read pairs of words distinguished by the comparative affix er (such as small/smaller) were able to generalize to other comparatives (e.g., mean/meaner), they could not generalize to pairs where er had no morphemic value (e.g., corn/corner). A similar failure by alphabetically naive children to detect the syllabic, as compared with the morphemic, status of the superlative affix est was found in Experiment 6. Overall, the results indicate that most preliterate children fail to select phonologically based hypotheses, even when these are available in the input. Instead, they focus on morphophonology and/or semantic aspects of words' referents. The research is couched in terms of the Learnability Theory (LT) (Gold, 1967), which provides a convenient framework for considering a series of interrelated questions about the acquisition of literacy.

"Goswami, U; East, M",Rhyme and analogy in beginning reading: Conceptual and methodological issues,APPLIED PSYCHOLINGUISTICS,"Goswami and Bryant (1990) proposed a theory of reading development based on three causal connections. One of these causal connections was based on the relationship between rhyming skills and reading development found in English. To explain this connection, they suggested that young readers of English used analogies based on rimes as one means of deciphering the alphabetic code. This proposal has recently become the subject of some debate. The most serious critique has been advanced by Seymour and his colleagues (Duncan, Seymour, & Hill, 1997; Seymour & Duncan, 1997; Seymour & Evans, 1994). These authors reported a series of studies with Scottish schoolchildren which, they claim, show that progression in normal reading acquisition is from a small unit (phonemic) approach in the initial stage to a large unit (rime-based) approach at a later stage. Two experiments are presented which replicate those conducted by Seymour and his group with samples of English schoolchildren. Different results are found. It is argued that methodological and instructional factors may be very important for the conceptual interpretation of studies attempting to pit small units (phonemes) against large units (onsets and rimes) in reading. In particular, it is necessary to consider whether a given phonological awareness task requires the recognition of shared phonological segments (epilinguistic processing) or the identification and production of shared phonological segments (metalinguistic processing). It is also important to take into account the nature of the literacy instruction being implemented in participating schools. If the phonological aspects of this tuition focus solely on phonemes (small units), then poor rime-level (large unit) performance may be found in metalinguistic tasks.",53,MAR,2000,21,1,63,93,,10.1017/S0142716400001041,1,1,replication in a different language,0,"Duncan, L.

In subject-initial utterances, is the planning unit the whole subject phrase or a smaller functional phrase within the subject phrase? Allum and Wheeldon (2007) reported that speakers show faster onset latencies in producing utterances like The flower above the house is red, where the subject consists of two functional phrases (the flower and above the house) than in producing The flower and the house are red, where there is a single, longer functional phrase (The flower and the house), both in head-initial languages like English and head-final languages like Japanese. This has been taken to suggest that the functional phrase is a preferred unit of planning, rather than the whole subject. Experiment 1 in the present study replicates Allum and Wheeldon's study with speakers of another head-final language (Mandarin Chinese) and finds similar results. Experiments 2 and 3 investigate whether syntactic processing or visual grouping could potentially explain the pattern of responses, and find that they cannot.

Experiment 1 measured immediate attention for radio speeches measured through moment-to-moment, self-report measures. Negative framing, compared with positive framing, increased immediate attention. Rhetorical schemes only increased attention in positively (but not in negatively) framed speeches. No effects on recall were found. In Experiment 2, immediate attention for similar radio speeches was measured through secondary task reaction times.

The learning is revealed in their speech errors. For example, if /f/ is artificially restricted to the syllable onset position and /s/ is restricted to the coda position, speakers' slips will respect these constraints, demonstrating learning. The mechanism behind this learning was investigated by reversal shift. In two experiments, speakers produced syllable sequences for 32 trials in which one consonant was constrained to be an onset and one, a coda. Then for the next 32 trials, the constraints were reversed; for example, /f/ is now a coda and /s/ an onset. Over a third block of 32 trials, the constraints were reversed again back to the original rule. The learning of the reversed rules was slow in comparison to rapid learning of the original rule, providing evidence that the underlying mechanism is incremental. To learn a reversed rule, first one must unlearn the original association before making progress on the new rule. This pattern of rapid initial learning and slow reversal learning was replicated in a nonspeech analogue of the syllable production task. Participants pushed sequences of buttons, in which finger presses corresponded to consonants and thumb presses to vowels. A control experiment found that non-reversal shifts between blocks are easily learned, showing that the difficulty is specifically with reversal shifts.

Low frequency TL words were responded to less accurately than control words in the naming but not the lexical decision task. Experiment 2 replicated the naming data of Experiment 1 and also revealed that naming accuracy for TL word targets was reduced when they were preceded by a brief masked presentation of their confusable mate. Experiment 3 provided a third replication of the impaired naming performance for TL target words and demonstrated that the effect was insensitive to concurrent dual task demands.

"Arnett, Nathan; Wagers, Matthew",Subject encodings and retrieval interference,JOURNAL OF MEMORY AND LANGUAGE,"Interference has been identified as a cause of processing difficulty in linguistic dependencies, such as the subject-verb relation (Van Dyke and Lewis, 2003). However, while mounting evidence implicates retrieval interference in sentence processing, the nature of the retrieval cues involved - and thus the source of difficulty - remains largely unexplored. Three experiments used self-paced reading and eyetracking to examine the ways in which the retrieval cues provided at a verb characterize subjects. Syntactic theory has identified a number of properties correlated with subjecthood, both phrase-structural and thematic. Findings replicate and extend previous findings of interference at a verb from additional subjects, but indicate that retrieval outcomes are relativized to the syntactic domain in which the retrieval occurs. One, the cues distinguish between thematic subjects in verbal and nominal domains. Two, within the verbal domain, retrieval is sensitive to abstract syntactic properties associated with subjects and their clauses. We argue that the processing at a verb requires cue-driven retrieval, and that the retrieval cues utilize abstract grammatical properties which may reflect parser expectations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Previous studies have shown a revelation effect for faces when the problem-solving task includes attractiveness ratings of the faces. Immediately after this problem-solving task participants judged faces as more familiar than without the problem-solving task. We replicated this result in Experiment 1. Based on the discrepancy-attribution hypothesis, we predicted that a problem-solving task that excludes attractiveness ratings would not elicit a revelation effect. However, we found a reversed revelation effect with a problem-solving task that required participants to solve a puzzle of each face (Experiments 2-3). In Experiments 2 and 3, participants judged faces as less familiar after the puzzle task. Our findings support the notion that the revelation effect may manifest as either an increase or a decrease of the experienced familiarity towards the recognition probe. However, our results contradict all current theories of the revelation effect. We discuss implications of our findings for revelation effect theories and provide a possible explanation.

A second variable, the relatedness among a word's meanings, has not been widely studied. In Experiment 1, Relatedness (High or Low), NOM (Many or Few), and nonword condition (legal nonwords or psuedohomorphones) were manipulated in lexical decision. No significant effects of NOM or Relatedness were observed in the legal nonword condition. However, in the pseudohomophone condition, Relatedness and NOM both produced significant main effects, and an interaction. Words with few, unrelated meanings produced the slowest response times (RTs); all other words produced statistically equivalent RTs. Results of the pseudohomophone condition of Experiment 1 were replicated in Experiment 2, except the main effect of NOM was not significant. The overall unreliability of NOM effects in these (and previous) experiments lead us to question the contribution of NOM to the observed interaction NOM metrics are often confounded with relatedness; words with many meanings tend to have highly related meanings. The results show that relatedness among meanings can influence lexical decision performance; the challenge is now to explore alternative measures, other than simple enumeration.

Since lip-read context also affects speech sound processing within this time frame, we investigated whether these two context effects on speech perception operate together. We measured ERPs while listeners were presented with auditory-only, audiovisual, or lip-read-only stimuli, in which the critical syllable that determined lexical status was naturally-timed (Experiment 1) or delayed by similar to 800 ms (Experiment 2). We replicated the electrophysiological effect of stimulus lexicality, and also observed substantial effects of audiovisual speech integration for words and pseudowords. Critically, we found several early time-windows (<400 ms) in which both contexts influenced auditory processes, but we never observed any cross-talk between the two types of speech context. The absence of any interaction between the two types of speech context supports the view that lip-read and lexical context mainly function separately, and may have different neural bases and purposes.

"Bailey, KGD; Ferreira, F",Disfluencies affect the parsing of garden-path sentences,JOURNAL OF MEMORY AND LANGUAGE,"Spontaneous speech differs in several ways from the sentences often studied in psycholinguistics experiments. One important difference is that naturally produced utterances often contain disfluencies. In this study, we examined how the presence of uh in a spoken sentence might affect processes that assign syntactic structure (i.e., parsing). Four experiments are reported. In the first, participants judged the grammaticality of sentences that had disfluencies either right before the head noun of the ambiguous phrase or after (e.g., Sandra bumped into the busboy and the uh uh waiter told her to be careful or Sandra bumped into the busboy and the waiter uh uh told her to be careful). Sentences in the latter condition were judged grammatical less often. This result was replicated in the second experiment, in which disfluencies were replaced with environmental sounds. These findings suggest that interruptions can affect syntactic parsing, and the content of the interruption need not be speechlike. In Experiments 3 and 4 we tested whether these effects occurred because listeners use interruptions as cues to help resolve a structural ambiguity. Results from these latter two grammaticality judgment tasks suggest that when an interruption occurs before an ambiguous noun phrase, comprehenders are more likely to assume that the noun phrase is the subject of a new clause rather than the object of an old one, and furthermore, it appears that the parser is relatively insensitive to the form of the interruption. We conclude that disfluencies can influence the parser by signaling a particular structure; at the same time, for the parser, a disfluency might be any interruption to the flow of speech.

In Experiment 1, five groups of participants (young, healthy old, healthy old-old, very mildly demented individuals. and mildly demented individuals) studied lists of high- and low-frequency words and were given a yes/no episodic recognition test. The results indicated that there was a dramatic decrease in hit rate For low-frequency words across age and DAT, but no decrease for high-frequency words, thereby eliminating the low-frequency advantage typically found in recognition performance for the DAT individuals, For the distractor items, there was a clear advantage in rejecting low-frequency words compared to high-frequency words, and the size of this advantage was constant across groups of participants. This between-group pattern was replicated in a second experiment, in which only young adults were required to respond either under short or long response deadlines. The results are discussed with respect to an attentional control framework in which cognitively impaired groups of participants. and young adults at a short response deadline, rely more on baseline familiarity processes than on recollection-based processes. Discussion focuses on the nature of the recollection- and familiarity-based processes.

"Belke, Eva",Long-lasting inhibitory semantic context effects on object naming are necessarily conceptually mediated: Implications for models of lexical-semantic encoding,JOURNAL OF MEMORY AND LANGUAGE,"When participants name several taxonomically related objects in close succession, they display persistent interference effects. Experimental manipulations of the semantic naming context have been used in two variants, a blocked and a continuous paradigm. Counterintuitively, results from previous studies suggest that the context effects induced by these paradigms arise at distinct levels of processing, namely at the lemma level (blocked paradigm), and at the interface of conceptual and lexical representations (continuous paradigm). In five experiments, both variants of the paradigm were assessed in object naming, semantic classification, word naming, and word-plus-determiner naming tasks. Experiments 1-3 show that participants display semantic context effects only in those tasks that mandatorily require conceptual processing (semantic classification, object naming). Experiment 4 fails to replicate the finding that, in the continuous paradigm, semantic context effects can transfer from object naming to word-plus-determiner naming but not vice versa, instead yielding no transfer in either direction. Experiment 5 demonstrates that the effects seen in semantic classification and object naming influence each other, suggesting that they are causally linked and that they both originate at the conceptual level. The implications of these findings for current accounts of lexical-semantic encoding in word production are discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

"Bell, Dane; Forster, Kenneth; Drake, Shiloh",Early semantic activation in a semantic categorization task with masked primes: Cascaded or not?,JOURNAL OF MEMORY AND LANGUAGE,"The assumption that activation is cascaded implies that the semantic properties of all neighbors of the input word are activated to varying degrees. This assumption is tested using masked priming in a semantic categorization experiment, where the prime belongs to the same category as the target (a congruent prime), or to a different category (an incongruent prime). In Experiment 1, the prime was a nonword neighbor of an exemplar or non-exemplar of the category, and a clear congruence effect was produced, even though the orthographic overlap was fairly low (e.g., lucchibi-zucchini). In Experiment 2, the prime was a word neighbor (e.g., capable-cabbage), which eliminates the possibility that the prime was simply interpreted as equivalent to the nearest task-relevant word, but a congruence effect was still obtained. Experiment 3 replicated this effect. Experiments 4-6 investigated the possible role of the category using a two-alternative forced choice discrimination task, where the task was simply to guess which of two subsequently presented words was more similar in meaning to the masked word. Despite better than chance performance when the masked word was related to one of the alternatives, performance was at chance when the masked word was a neighbor of a word that was related to one of the alternatives, indicating that semantic activation is not normally cascaded. It is concluded that the categorization task fundamentally alters the way in which a masked word is processed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

"Birdsong, D; Molis, M",On the evidence for maturational constraints in second-language acquisition,JOURNAL OF MEMORY AND LANGUAGE,"Second-language (L2) acquisition is generally thought to be constrained by maturational factors that circumscribe a critical period for nativelike attainment. Consistent with the maturational view are age effects among learners who begin L2 acquisition prior to, but not after, closure of the putative critical period. Also favoring the maturational account is the scarcity of late L2 learners at asymptote who perform like natives, and weak effects of native language-target language pairings. With Korean and Chinese learners of English, the experimental study of Johnson and Newport (1989) yielded just these types of evidence. Some subsequent studies do not support the critical period account of L2 acquisition constraints, however. Accordingly, we undertook a replication of Johnson and Newport (1989), using the exact methods and materials of the original experiment, and a sample of Spanish natives (n = 61). In keeping with recent research, L2 attainment negatively correlates with age of learning even if learning commences after the presumed end of the critical period. We also find modest evidence of nativelike attainment among late learners. Our data further suggest that the outcome of L2 acquisition may depend on L1-L2 pairings and L2 use.

"Bornkessel, I; McElree, B; Schlesewsky, M; Friederici, AD",Multi-dimensional contributions to garden path strength: Dissociating phrase structure from case marking,JOURNAL OF MEMORY AND LANGUAGE,"Psycholinguistic investigations of reanalysis phenomena have typically focused on revisions of phrase structure. Here, we identify a further subcomponent of syntactic reanalysis, namely the revision of case marking. This aspect of reanalysis was isolated by examining German subject object ambiguities that require a revision towards a dative-initial order. Since dative-initial orders are potentially unmarked, no phrase structure corrections are required, but the original, preference-based nominative assignment must be revised. Experiment 1, an ERP study, revealed an N400 component for reanalysis of case marking, which contrasted with a P600 component for phrase structure revisions. The 're-analysis N400' was replicated in Experiment 2, which also showed that direct lexical support for a dative-initial order leads to a reduction of the effect. Finally, in Experiment 3, direct time course measures provided by the speed-accuracy trade-off (SAT) procedure supported the case reanalysis account by showing that conditions hypothesized to involve case reanalysis (dative-initial structures) require longer computation times than their nominative-initial counterparts. Lexeme-specific support for the dative-initial reading, however, does not lead to a faster computation of the target structure. but rather increases the likelihood that the correct interpretation will be computed. We interpret these findings as evidence for the general availability of an unmarked dative-nominative word order in German, the accessibility of which may be increased by lexical information. Moreover, the data show that syntactic reanalysis is not a homogeneous process. but may rather be subdivided along several dimensions that interact in determining overall garden path strength.

We examined whether listeners are actually sensitive to this information. Experiment 1 replicated Smith and Clark's study; respondents were tested on general knowledge questions, surveyed about their FOK (feeling-of-knowing) for these questions, and tested for recognition of answers. In Experiment 2, listeners heard spontaneous verbal responses from Experiment 1 and were tested on their feeling-of-another's-knowing (FOAK) to see if metacognitive information was reliably conveyed by the surface form of responses. For answers, rising intonation and Longer latencies led to fewer FOAK ratings by listeners. For nonanswers, longer latencies led to higher FOAK ratings. In Experiment 3, electronically edited responses with 1-s latencies led to higher FOAK ratings for answers and lower FOAK ratings for nonanswers than those with 5-s latencies. Filled pauses led to lower ratings for answers and higher ratings for nonanswers than did unfilled pauses. There was no support for a filler-as-morpheme hypothesis, that ''um'' and ''uh'' contrast in meaning.

Results showed two replications of the levels of processing dissociation found in Experiment 1 and a further dissociation between performance of the younger and older adults; younger adults performed significantly better than older adults in the explicit test but not in the implicit test. Because the forename/surname stimuli in name generation have strong associative connections but minimal semantic connections, it follows that associative connections are implicated when priming of strongly related word pails fails to benefit From conceptual elaboration.

Thus far, analyses of the time-course of interpretation suggest that partner-specific information may not constrain the initial interpretation of referring expressions [Barr, D. J., & Keysar, B. (2002). Anchoring comprehension in linguistic precedents. Journal of Memory and Language, 46, 391-418; Krommuller, E., & Barr, D. J. (2007). Perspective-free pragmatics: Broken precedents and the recovery-from-preemption hypothesis. Journal of Memory and Language, 56, 436-455]. However, these studies used non-interactive paradigms, which may limit the use of partner-specific representations. This article presents the results of three eye-tracking experiments. Experiment la used an interactive conversation methodology in which the experimenter and participant jointly established entrained terms for various images. On critical trials, the same experimenter, or a new experimenter described a critical image using an entrained term, or a new term. The results demonstrated an early, online partner-specific effect for interpretation of entrained terms, as well as preliminary evidence for an early, partner-specific effect for new terms. Experiment 1b used a non-interactive paradigm in which participants completed the same task by listening to image descriptions recorded during Experiment 1a; the results showed that partner-specific effects were eliminated. Experiment 2 replicated the partner-specific findings of Experiment 1 a with an interactive paradigm and scenes that contained previously unmentioned images. The results suggest that partner-specific interpretation is most likely to occur in interactive dialog settings; the number of critical trials and stimulus characteristics may also play a role. The results are consistent with a large body of work demonstrating that the language processing system uses a rich source of contextual and pragmatic representations to guide on-line processing decisions.

A Bayesian meta-analysis,JOURNAL OF MEMORY AND LANGUAGE,"When participants in an experiment have to name pictures while ignoring distractor words superimposed on the picture or presented auditorily (i.e., picture-word interference paradigm), they take more time when the word to be named (or target) and distractor words are from the same semantic category (e.g., cat-dog). This experimental effect is known as the semantic interference effect, and is probably one of the most studied in the language production literature. The functional origin of the effect and the exact conditions in which it occurs are however still debated. Since Lupker (1979) reported the effect in the first response time experiment about 40 years ago, more than 300 similar experiments have been conducted. The semantic interference effect was replicated in many experiments, but several studies also reported the absence of an effect in a subset of experimental conditions. The aim of the present study is to provide a comprehensive theoretical review of the existing evidence to date and several Bayesian meta-analyses and meta-regressions to determine the size of the effect and explore the experimental conditions in which the effect surfaces.

"Chateau, D; Jared, D",Spelling-sound consistency effects in disyllabic word naming,JOURNAL OF MEMORY AND LANGUAGE,"The present study investigated the role of spelling-sound consistency in naming printed disyllabic words. Participants in Experiment 1 named 1000 monomorphemic six-letter disyllabic words. Spelling-sound consistency measures for 11 orthographic segments were used to predict the naming latencies and error rates on the words. The consistency of vowel segments, particularly the one in the second syllable, contributed significantly to the prediction of naming latencies and error rates. In addition, the consistency of the BOB (body-of-the-BOSS, which is the orthographic segment containing the first vowel grapheme and as many following consonants as make an orthographically legal word ending) was also a significant predictor. The effect of the spelling-sound consistency of BOB and V-2 segments was replicated in factorial experiments. These findings suggest that readers learn spelling-sound relationships not only for individual letters of graphemes but also for larger orthographic segments in disyllabic words, likely those that provide information about pronunciations beyond that of the individual letters of which they are composed. This study provides the kind of information that is needed to extend current models of word recognition beyond their current focus on monosyllabic words to more complex words.

Based on the assumption that the representation of concrete words includes an imagistic code whereas that of abstract words does not, Parker and Dagnall (2009) predicted that DVN should disrupt visual working memory and selectively interfere with memory for concrete words. They observed a reversal of the concreteness effect in both a delayed free recall and a delayed recognition test. In six studies, we partially replicate and extend their work. In Experiments 1 (delayed free recall) and 2 (delayed recognition), DVN abolished, but did not reverse, the concreteness effect. Experiments 3 and 4 found no effect of DVN on a prototypical working memory task, immediate serial recall: concreteness effects were observed in both the control and DVN conditions. In contrast, Experiment 5 showed that DVN abolished the concreteness effect in an immediate serial recognition test. In the final experiment, subjects did not know whether they would receive an immediate serial recall or an immediate serial recognition test until after the list had been presented. Nonetheless, DVN had no effect on immediate serial recall but once again eliminated the concreteness effect on immediate serial recognition.

The tasks used consisted of rating how appropriate sentences (containing one of these prepositions) were to describe a series of pictures. For example, the pictures comprised a person holding an object with the function of protection from falling objects (e.g., an umbrella). Each picture was depicted with the object shown as fulfilling its function or not at different geometric positions. The results of Experiment I show a significant effect of functional relations on the ratings given. However, while over/under were very sensitive to functional relations, above/below were more influenced by geometric relations. The second experiment replicates these effects with objects depicting noncanonical functions (e.g., a suitcase sheltering someone from rain). Experiment 3 manipulated frame of reference and found evidence for conflict of frames of reference effects on the rating of above/below, but not in the same way for over/under. Conversely the ratings of over/under were found to be affected by functionality while those for above/below were not. These results indicate for the first time that spatial prepositions are differentially influenced by geometric and functional relations.

When a gender marked article immediately preceded the noun [e.g., cliquez sur le bouton (click on the((masc.)) button)], the early activation of the gender-inconsistent cohort was completely eliminated (Experiment 2).

A form-preparation paradigm that showed priming effects for words with initial form overlap was used to investigate whether words with form overlap, but different spelling (e.g., camel-kidney) also show priming.

To divert participants' attention from the spelling of the targets, Experiment 3 was conducted entirely in the auditory domain, but yielded the same outcome as before.

Here, participants heard eight-syllable sequences with a lexically ambiguous four-syllable ending (e.g., crisis turnip vs. cry sister nip). The prosodic characteristics of the initial five syllables were resynthesized in a manner predicted to favor parsing of the final syllables as either a monosyllabic or a disyllabic word; the acoustic characteristics of the final three syllables were held constant. Experiments la-c replicated earlier results showing that utterance-initial prosody influences segmentation utterance-finally, even when lexical content is removed through low-pass filtering, and even when an on-line cross-modal paradigm is used. Experiments 2 and 3 pitted distal prosody against, respectively, distal semantic context and prosodic attributes of the test words themselves.

"Dillon, Brian; Mishler, Alan; Sloggett, Shayne; Phillips, Colin",Contrasting intrusion profiles for agreement and anaphora: Experimental and modeling evidence,JOURNAL OF MEMORY AND LANGUAGE,"We investigated the relationship between linguistic representation and memory access by comparing the processing of two linguistic dependencies that require comprehenders to check that the subject of the current clause has the correct morphological features: subject-verb agreement and reflexive anaphors in English. In two eye-tracking experiments we examined the impact of structurally illicit noun phrases on the computation of reflexive and subject-verb agreement. Experiment 1 directly compared the two dependencies within participants. Results show a clear difference in the intrusion profile associated with each dependency: agreement resolution displays clear intrusion effects in comprehension (as found by Pearlmutter, Garnsey, & Bock, 1999; Wagers, Lau, & Phillips, 2009), but reflexives show no such intrusion effect from illicit antecedents (Sturt, 2003; Xiang, Dillon, 82 Phillips, 2009). Experiment 2 replicated the lack of intrusion for reflexives, confirming the reliability of the pattern and examining a wider range of feature combinations. In addition, we present modeling evidence that suggests that the reflexive results are best captured by a memory retrieval mechanism that uses primarily syntactic information to guide retrievals for the anaphor's antecedent, in contrast to the mixed morphological and syntactic cues used resolve subject-verb agreement dependencies. Despite the fact that agreement and reflexive dependencies are subject to a similar morphological agreement constraint, in online processing comprehenders appear to implement this constraint in distinct ways for the two dependencies.

Using a dual-task paradigm, Papagno, Valentine, and Baddeley (1991) found that articulatory suppression, loading verbal working memory, had an effect on the memorizing of word-nonword pairs, but not on the memorizing of word-concrete word pairs. The present work explored the potential for visual codes in unfamiliar word learning. In a first experiment, we replicated the results of Papagno et al. for both nonwords and highly imageable nouns. In addition, we found that articulatory suppression disrupted the memorizing of word-abstract word pairs, suggesting that phonological involvement may be triggered by the absence of visual representations for the abstract words. Experiment 2 showed that an artificially induced association between a nonword and a nonnameable visual image was sufficient to compensate for diminished verbal working memory resources due to articulatory suppression.

"Evans, JSBT; Clibbens, J; Rood, B",The role of implicit and explicit negation in conditional reasoning bias,JOURNAL OF MEMORY AND LANGUAGE,"Matching bias in conditional reasoning consists of a tendency to select as relevant cases whose lexical content marches thai referred to in the conditional statement, regardless of the presence of negatives. Evans (1983) demonstrated that use of explicit rather than implicit negative eases markedly reduced the matching bias effect on the conditional truth table task. In apparent contrast, recent studies of explicit negation on the Wason selection task have failed to iind evidence of logical facilitation. Experiment I of the present study strongly replicated the Evans (1983) findings and extended them to three forms of conditional statement. Experiments 2 and 3 showed further that the use of explicit negatives removed completely the matching bias effect on the Wason selection task. However, consistent with other recent studies, this elimination of bias did not lead to facilitation of correct responding. The findings are interpreted as providing evidence chat matching bias reflects a linguistically cued relevance effect.

A within-subjects design (Experiment 1) suggested that after this initial rapid increase, false recall continued to increase gradually to an apex at the balanced hybrid list composition, whereas a between-subjects design (Experiment 2) showed that false recall plateaued after the initial rapid increase and that the overall shape of the function is a ziggurat. Furthermore, the function is roughly symmetrical; semantic and phonological associates appear to make equivalent contributions to over-additive false recall from hybrid lists. The results provide constraints on theoretical accounts of DRM false memories, and can be accommodated by a modified activation/monitoring framework. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

"Forrin, Noah D.; Ralph, Brandon C. W.; Dhaliwal, Navi K.; Smilek, Daniel; MacLeod, Colin M.",Wait for it...performance anticipation reduces recognition memory,JOURNAL OF MEMORY AND LANGUAGE,"Conventional wisdom suggests that there is an encoding decrement prior to performing in front of others. We hypothesized that this pre-performance memory deficit-the next-in-line effect (Brenner, 1973)-should also occur in the context of mixed-list memory experiments where one of the conditions requires performance. As the testing ground for this prediction, we used the production effect (i.e., enhanced memory for words that are read aloud vs. silently). Specifically, we examined whether performance anticipation imposes a memorial cost on silent items studied in a mixed list (among performed aloud items) relative to a pure-silent list. Experiment 1 established this mixed-list cost in recognition (replicating Bodner, Taikh, & Fawcett, 2014). In Experiments 2 and 3, providing foreknowledge of the task to be performed on upcoming study items-thereby allowing participants to see when they would have to read aloud-led to diminished memory for silent items that were studied immediately before aloud items. In Experiment 4, in the absence of an experimenter, the pre-performance cost to silent items was non-significant (with Bayesian evidence supporting the null), consistent with the notion that the presence of the experimenter (a social factor) contributed to performance anticipation. Taken together, these results imply that performance anticipation drives the mixed-list cost of production shown by the silent items (and may explain costs observed in other memory research). Performance anticipation may reduce memory for pre-performance information by diverting attention away from that information.",1,DEC,2019,109,,,,104050,10.1016/j.jml.2019.104050,1,1,,0,"Forrin, N.

"Frisson, Steven; Harvey, David R.; Staub, Adrian",No prediction error cost in reading: Evidence from eye movements,JOURNAL OF MEMORY AND LANGUAGE,"Two eye movement while reading experiments address the issue of how reading of an unpredictable word is influenced by the presence of a more predictable alternative. The experiments replicate the robust effects of predictability on the probability of skipping and on early and late reading time measures. However, in both experiments, an unpredictable but plausible word was read no more slowly when another word was highly predictable (i.e., in a constraining context) than when no word was highly predictable (i.e., in a neutral context). In fact, an unpredictable word that was semantically related to the predictable alternative demonstrated facilitation in the constraining context, in relatively late eye movement measures. These results, which are consistent with Luke and Christianson's (2016) corpus study, provide the first evidence from a controlled experimental design for the absence of a prediction error cost, and for facilitation of an unpredictable but semantically related word, during normal reading. The findings support a model of lexical predictability effects in which there is broad pre-activation of potential continuations, rather than discrete predictions of specific lexical items. Importantly, pre-activation of likely continuations does not result in processing difficulty when some other word is actually encountered. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The discriminatory efficiency hypotheses claims that speakers place the most discriminating adjective early to facilitate referent identification. By contrast, the availability-based ordering hypothesis assumes that speakers produce most available adjectives early to ease production. Experiment 1 showed that speakers use more pattern-before-color modifier orders (than the reversed) when pattern, not color, distinguished the referent from alternatives, providing support for the discriminatory efficiency hypothesis. Participants also overspecified color more often than pattern, and they generally favored color-before-pattern orders, in support of the availability-based ordering hypothesis. Experiments 2 and 3 replicated both effects in a dialogue setting, where speakers' adjective ordering was also primed by their partner's ordering, using conjoined and non-conjoined constructions.

Experiments 1-3 replicate the modification effect and demonstrate that this effect is obtained when participants make dichotomous decisions about the truth of such statements. In addition, measures of processing time indicate that properties are not immediately inherited during the composition process, but rather must be inferred. Experiments 2-3 included statements containing content-free modifiers (chonk ducks have webbed feet) to examine the extent to which the modification effect is influenced by the content of the modifier and knowledge about the combined concepts. Taken together, these results argue in favor of an inferential process that operates at the level of logical forms or structures, which are content-free, as well as operating on the content of the head noun category.

We confirmed this variability in Experiment I by constructing lists in the typical fashion but with words that were weakly associated to their critical words. Low levels of false recall occurred. In Experiment 2 these results were replicated at three presentation rates (.5, 1, and 3 s per word). Also, slower presentation rates yielded lower false recall for both strong and weak lists. Experiment 3 showed that false recognition rates also varied across lists, as did subjective ratings accompanying false recognition. We interpret these findings as supporting an activation/monitoring framework. Lists vary in a principled way in their tendency to activate the critical item, and slowing the presentation rate permits greater accrual of item-specific information that makes monitoring of retrieval more accurate.

The temporary ambiguity concerned whether a noun following a verb was its direct object (The senator regretted the decision immediately.), or instead the subject of an embedded clause (The senator regretted the decision had been made public.). The experiments crossed the plausibility of the temporarily ambiguous noun as a direct object (e.g., The senator regretted the decision ... vs The senator regretted the reporter ...) with verb bias, eliminating a confound present in earlier research and allowing an examination of interactions between the two factors. Unbiased verbs were included as well to evaluate the role of plausibility in the absence of verb bias. The results generally replicated Trueswell, Tanenhaus, and Kello's (1993) finding that verb bias has rapid effects on ambiguity resolution, and showed in addition that verb bias and plausibility interact during comprehension.

This research is founded on the assumption that JOLs directly reflect underlying representations of probability, which, if true, should mean that results from studies employing per cent JOL scales will generalize to other measures of subjective probability. We report four experiments that tested this assumption in the context of the underconfidence-with-practice (UWP) effect, the finding that JOLs underestimate recall on second and subsequent study-test cycles of multi-cycle paired-associate learning tasks (e.g., Koriat, Sheffer, 82 Ma'ayan, 2002). In particular, after replicating the standard UWP effect with scale JOLs in Experiment 1, we tested whether the effect would generalize to a binary JOL judgment in Experiment 2 and/or a binary betting decision in Experiment 3. In neither experiment was the UWP effect observed. Finally, to ensure that memorial and metamemorial evidence was equated for each judgment type, each item was assigned both a scale JOL and a binary betting decision in Experiment 4. UWP was observed for the 0-100% scale JOL, but not the binary betting decision. Together, the results suggest that JOLs may not directly reflect subjective probability but rather reflect an initial yes/no decision about future recall followed by a confidence rating.

(1975)",JOURNAL OF MEMORY AND LANGUAGE,"The lexical bias effect is the tendency for phonological speech errors to result in words more often than in nonwords. This effect has been accounted for by postulating feedback from sublexical to lexical representations, but also by assuming that the self-monitor covertly repairs more nonword errors than word errors. The only evidence that appears to exclusively support a monitoring account is Baars, Motley, and MacKay's (1975) demonstration that the lexical bias is modulated by context: There was lexical bias in a mixed context of words and nonwords, but not in a pure nonword context. However, there are methodological problems with that experiment and theoretical problems with its interpretation. Additionally, a recent study failed to replicate contextual modulation (Humphreys, 2002). We therefore conducted two production experiments that solved the methodological problems. Both experiments showed there is indeed contextual modulation of the lexical bias effect. A control perception experiment excluded the possibility that the comprehension component of the task contributed to the results. In contrast to Baars et al., the production experiments suggested that lexical errors are suppressed in a nonword context. This supports a new account by which there is both feedback and self-monitoring, but in which the self-monitor sets its criteria adaptively as a function of context. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Bock and Miller (1991) have shown that constituents modifying the subject exert an attraction effect, an increased rate of agreement errors when that constituent has a grammatical number different from that of the subject head noun. Experiment Ia. conducted in Dutch, showed that such an attraction effect is not restricted to sentences in which the number mismatching information is embedded within the subject: Direct-object noun phrases exert an attraction effect as well, although a smaller one than subject modifier noun phrases. Experiment lb replicated this effect with new materials, excluding a possible confound with plausibility of the sentences. Experiment 2 showed that direct-object pronouns exert an attraction effect about as strong as that observed with nouns, unless the pronoun is explicitly case-marked. In such circumstances no attraction effect obtains. These results are interpreted within the hypothesis that the number of phrasal nodes intervening between attractor and subject head noun determines the strength of attraction effects.

In the current study, we sought to determine how items might be differentially encoded based on their value. In Experiment 1, participants studied words associated with point-values which were followed by a cue to either Remember the word for a later test or Forget the word. While to-be-forgotten words were recognized at a lower rate than to-be-remembered words, there was a significant effect of value for to-be-forgotten words when the Forget cue was presented immediately after the word, suggesting a relatively automatic enhancement of encoding by value. In Experiment 2, we examined to what extent participants engage in more effective encoding strategies for high-value items. Participants studied a list of words with different point-values, and were instructed either to construct a mental image of the item, use rote rehearsal to learn the items, or were not given any study strategy. There were significant effects of value for items that were studied under rote rehearsal or when no strategy instruction was given. However, effects of value were nearly eliminated when participants used a mental imagery strategy for all items as this strategy boosted memory for low-value items. In Experiment 3, we sought to replicate Experiment 2 with an encoding manipulations that required responses on each trial as a manipulation check. Participants were instructed to generate a sentence containing each item, count the consonants in each item, or were not given any encoding instructions. Consistent with Experiment 2, these manipulations eliminated the effects of value on recognition memory. Thus, it appears that participants engage in more effective encoding strategies for high-value words because the benefit of value was substantially reduced when participants were required to use the same encoding strategy for all items. Together, these results suggest that valuable items are encoded more effectively due to strategic, and to a lesser extent, automatic mechanisms.",1,JUN,2019,106,,29,39,,10.1016/j.jml.2019.02.001,1,1,inner-paper replication,0,same,same,1,2019,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,conceptual,English,NA,1,,

To date, there has been little research looking at the propensity to include one's own responses when trying to recall a partner's previous contribution to the group. Experiment I demonstrated that people make both kinds of source-error during recall, but source errors are more common in the recall-partner task. This pattern was replicated in Experiments 2a and 2b with source-errors and intrusions increasing over a delay. Experiment 3 used an extended version of each recall task, in which participants reported all items that came to mind, whilst indicating which responses were goal-relevant. The tendency for source-errors to occur more for the recall-partner task was shown to be a function of both idea availability and output monitoring, whereas the tendency for source-errors to increase over a delay was shown to be due solely to output monitoring. Thus, unconscious plagiarism errors are one instantiation of the more general problem of source-specified recall, which is influenced jointly by processes at generation and output monitoring.

Experiment 1 supported this hypothesis by showing that speakers produced more representational gestures when describing patterns they had physically made than when describing patterns they had only viewed.

"Hunt, R. Reed; Smith, Rebekah E.; Dunlap, Kathryn R.",How does distinctive processing reduce false recall?,JOURNAL OF MEMORY AND LANGUAGE,"False memories arising from associatively related lists are a robust phenomenon that resists many efforts to prevent it. However, a few variables have been shown to reduce this form of false memory. Explanations for how the reduction is accomplished have focused on either output monitoring processes or constraints on access, but neither idea alone is sufficient to explain extant data. Our research was driven by a framework that distinguishes item-based and event-based distinctive processing to account for the effects of different variables on both correct recall of study list items and false recall. We report the results of three experiments examining the effect of a deep orienting task and the effect of visual presentation of study items, both of which have been shown to reduce false recall. The experiments replicate those previous findings and add important new information about the effect of the variables on a recall test that eliminates the need for monitoring. The results clearly indicate that both post-access monitoring and constraints on access contribute to reductions in false memories. The results also showed that the manipulations of study modality and orienting task had different effects on correct and false recall, a pattern that was predicted by the item-based/event-based distinctive processing framework.

"Kim, J; Davis, C",Task effects in masked cross-script translation and phonological priming,JOURNAL OF MEMORY AND LANGUAGE,"This study examined cross-language masked priming with Korean-English unbalanced bilinguals. The aim was to determine if the type of prime and target relationship and the type of response task would modulate across-language priming effects. The nature of the relationship between prime (Korean: L1) and target (English: L2) pairs was manipulated so that they shared semantics and phonology (cognate translations), semantics only (noncognate translations), phonology only (homophones), or neither phonology nor semantics (baseline). These prime types were tested in three different response tasks, i.e., lexical decision, naming, and semantic categorization. In the lexical decision task (Experiment 1), significant priming from cognate and noncognate translation primes was observed. Homophone primes did not produce a significant priming effect.]it the naming task (Experiment 2), both cognate and homophone primes produced significant priming effects but the noncognate translation primes did not. Experiment 3 replicated the homophone priming effect and showed that it was unlikely to be due to the shared initial phonemes of primes and targets. Finally, the semantic categorization task (Experiment 4) showed cognate and noncognate translation priming but not homophone priming. The results indicated that priming was affected both by prime-target relationship and by task type; this outcome was discussed in terms of the regulation of lexical information by a task-decision system.

"Knoeferle, Pia; Crocker, Matthew W.",The influence of recent scene events on spoken comprehension: Evidence from eye movements,JOURNAL OF MEMORY AND LANGUAGE,"Evidence from recent experiments that monitored attention in clipart scenes during spoken comprehension suggests that people preferably rely on non-stereotypical depicted events over stereotypical thematic knowledge for incremental interpretation. The Coordinated Interplay Account [Knoeferle, P. & Crocker, M. W. (2006). The coordinated interplay of scene, utterance, and world knowledge: evidence from eye tracking. Cognitive Science, 30, 481-529.] accounts for this preference through referential processing (e.g., the verb mediates a depicted event) and the preferred use of scene event information that is associated with the referent (e.g., the agent of the depicted event). Three eye-tracking experiments examined the generality of this account. While the rapid use of depicted events was replicated in all three studies, the preference to rely on them was modulated by the decay of events that were no longer co-present. Our findings motivate the extension of the Coordinated Interplay Account with an explicit working memory. The coordinated interplay mechanism together with working memory and decay, is shown to account for the influence of scene-derived versus stored knowledge both when events are co-present and when they have recently been perceived.

"Kwon, Nayoung; Sturt, Patrick",The use of control information in dependency formation: An eye-tracking study,JOURNAL OF MEMORY AND LANGUAGE,"Recent research has shown much evidence that sentence comprehension can be extremely predictive. However, we currently know little about the limits of predictive processing. In the two eye-tracking experiments, we examined whether predictive information in dependency formation is inevitably given priority over a well-known structural preference in syntactic ambiguity resolution. Experiment 1 used sentences including control nouns like order (e.g. After Andrew's order to wash the kids came over to the house). If predictive dependency information is given priority over disambiguation preferences, then readers could immediately interpret the kids as the ones who have been ordered to wash, thus avoiding the garden path at the main verb came. However, garden path effects were found irrespective of control information, although the garden path difficulty was reduced when the lexical control information highlighted the globally correct analysis (as in the above example), relative to when it did not. Experiment 2 replicated these results with adjunct control, where the relevant dependency is obligatory (e.g. After refusing to wash the kids came over to the house). Again, control information did not influence initial disambiguation, but did affect the difficulty of garden path recovery. Overall, the results suggest that there are limitations on the influence of predictive dependency formation on on-line structural disambiguation.

The present study examines how semantic and non-semantic contextual variations in word learning encounters impact learning the meanings of novel words. Across two experiments, highly proficient Spanish-English bilinguals studied rare words in repeated or varied semantic contexts, presented in only one language or in both languages. Participants recalled more word meanings when semantic context was varied rather than repeated at study, and this effect did not differ for the more and less proficient languages. However, varying the language context provided no benefit relative to studying words in only one language. Performance patterns were consistent for visual and auditory study modalities, and in both recall and recognition tasks, performance was less accurate overall in the less proficient language than in the more proficient language.

Using passages in which protagonists part and later reunite, in Experiment 1 we replicated the finding (Greene, Gerrig, McKoon, & Ratcliff, 1994) that their reunion reactivates text elements that were part of their common ground. In Experiment 2, we tested two accounts of this effect: (a) readers reactivate the contents of protagonists' common ground by way of preparing for their interaction; and (b) low-level memory processes reactivate text elements associated with the protagonist returning to the reader's focus. We found that the pattern of reactivation was almost identical whether the text element was part of common ground or not, supporting the memory-based account. In Experiment 3 we obtained evidence that despite the lack of role for common ground in reactivating distant information, readers are indeed aware of who knows what about whom in short texts.

"Lee, Chia-lin; Federmeier, Kara D.",Wave-ering: An ERP study of syntactic and semantic context effects on ambiguity resolution for noun/verb homographs,JOURNAL OF MEMORY AND LANGUAGE,"Two event-related potential experiments investigated the effects of syntactic and semantic context information on the processing of noun/verb (NV) homographs (e.g., park). Experiment 1 embedded NV-homographs and matched unambiguous words in contexts that provided only syntactic Cues or both syntactic and semantic constraints. Replicating prior work, when only syntactic information was available NV-homographs elicited sustained frontal negativity relative to unambiguous words. Semantic constraints eliminated this frontal ambiguity effect. Semantic constraints also reduced N400 amplitudes, but less so for homographs than unambiguous words. Experiment 2 showed that this reduced N400 facilitation was limited to cases in which the semantic context picks out a non-dominant meaning, likely reflecting the semantic mismatch between the context and residual, automatic activation of the contextually-inappropriate dominant sense. Overall, the findings suggest that ambiguity resolution in context involves the interplay between multiple neural networks, some involving more automatic semantic processing mechanisms and others involving top-down control mechanisms.

"Lindsay, Shane; Sedin, Leanne M.; Gaskell, M. Gareth",Acquiring novel words and their past tenses: Evidence from lexical effects on phonetic categorisation,JOURNAL OF MEMORY AND LANGUAGE,"Two experiments addressed how novel verbs come to be represented in the auditory input lexicon, and how the inflected forms of such novel words are acquired and recognised. Participants were introduced to new spoken forms as uninflected verbs. These varied in whether they contained a final /d/ (e.g., confald or confal). Either immediately after training or a week later they performed phonetic categorisation on variants of these forms that ended with an ambiguous phoneme on a /d/-/t/ continuum. Lexical influences in categorisation would be demonstrated by a /d/ response bias, consistent with either the learnt uninflected form (e.g., confald) or a regular past tense inflection of the learnt form (e.g., confalled). In Experiment 1, lexical effects on categorisation were present for both word types, immediately and a week after exposure. Experiment 2 replicated and extended these findings using degraded stimuli. While lexical effects on response choice were present straight away, lexical facilitation of response speed was stronger after a week. These findings provide evidence for an account of verb learning in which rapidly stored word form information can have immediate lexical properties in some respects, such as allowing generalisation of existing knowledge of verb morphology to new words. However, consolidation over time enhances these representations, enabling swift lexical influences on phoneme perception. Implications for theories of the representation of inflectional forms and the time course of lexical processing of novel words are discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Previous reports have indicated that nonwords from high density neighborhoods are repeated with shorter latency than nonwords from low density neighborhoods (e.g., Vitevitch & Luce, 1998).

Experiment 2 employed stimuli with reduced durational differences, finding that there was no effect of neighborhood density on repetition latency when stimulus duration was statistically controlled. Experiments 3 and 4 replicated these results with an alternative presentation regimen.

We report three experiments examining whether such effects reflect delayed acquisition of the passive syntax or instead are an artifact of the experimental task, relating to children's poor picture recognition for such verbs. In two syntactic priming experiments, 3- and 4-year-olds produced more agent-patient passives after hearing passive primes involving agent-patient and theme-experiencer verbs (Experiment 1), and theme-experiencer and experiencer-theme verbs (Experiment 2), than after corresponding active primes: moreover, the magnitude of priming was unaffected by verb type. However, a picture-sentence matching task (Experiment 3) replicated previous findings: Children performed more poorly on experiencer-theme sentences than agent-patient sentences. Our results suggest that children's acquisition of passive syntax is not delayed, and that semantic effects found in previous studies may instead be task-related. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

"Meyer, AS; Roelofs, A; Levelt, WJM",Word length effects in object naming: The role of a response criterion,JOURNAL OF MEMORY AND LANGUAGE,"According to Levelt, Roelofs, and Meyer (1999) speakers generate the phonological and phonetic representations of successive syllables of a word in sequence and only begin to speak after having fully planned at least one complete phonological word. Therefore, speech onset latencies should be longer for long than for short words. We tested this prediction in four experiments in which Dutch participants named or categorized objects with monosyllabic or disyllabic names. Experiment I yielded a length effect on production latencies when objects with long and short names were tested in separate blocks, but not when they were mixed. Experiment 2 showed that the length effect was not due to a difference in the ease of object recognition. Experiment 3 replicated the results of Experiment I using a within-participants design. In Experiment 4, the long and short target words appeared in a phrasal context. In addition to the speech onset latencies, we obtained the viewing times for the target objects, which have been shown to depend on the time necessary to plan the form of the target names. We found word length effects for both dependent variables, but only when objects with short and long names were presented in separate blocks. We argue that in pure and mixed blocks speakers used different response deadlines, which they tried to meet by either generating the motor programs for one syllable or for all syllables of the word before speech onset. Computer simulations using WEAVER++ support this view. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

For example, count nouns but not mass nouns can be pluralized and can appear with the indefinite article. Some scholars dismiss the distinction as an arbitrary convention of language whereas others suggest that it is conceptually based. The present studies examined this issue with respect to aggregates (i.e., entities composed of multiple constituents that are generally homogenous). Experiment I demonstrated that participants rate the elements of familiar count noun aggregates (e.g., grapes and toothpicks) as more perceptually distinguishable than those of familiar mass noun aggregates (e.g., rice and confetti). They also were more likely to interact with one or a few elements of count noun aggregates but with multiple elements of mass noun aggregates. Experiment 2 replicated these results using a different sample of aggregates. In Experiments 3 and 4 manipulation of these factors predicted whether participants labeled a novel aggregate with a novel count or mass noun. These results show that for aggregates, count and mass noun usage is to a large degree conceptually based. The conceptual basis is consistent with the principle of cognitive individuation: speakers conceptualize the referents of count nouns as distinct individuals and the referents of mass nouns as non-individuated entities. However, we also identified exceptions to this view and suggest that they arise from linguistic convention or competing linguistic functions. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

We show that this occurs in Maltese, even though the glottal stop also occurs as a phoneme in Maltese. As a consequence, words with and without an underlying (phonemic) glottal stop (e.g., a glottal stop-zero minimal pair qal /?a:l/ vs. ghal /a:l/ Engl., 'he said'-'because') can become homophonous in connected speech. We first tested the extent of this phonetic marking of vowel-initial words in a production experiment and found that even in fluent productions, about half of the vowel-initial words are marked with an epenthetic glottal stop. The epenthetic glottal stop is more likely to occur when the preceding word is longer, showing a kind of preboundary lengthening at a phrase-level prosodic boundary. A subsequent perception study (Experiment 2) using a two-alternative forced-choice task with a minimal pair of a glottal stop-initial and a vowel-initial word indicated that listeners are sensitive to the durationally conditioned prosodic context before the test word, and they are more likely to perceive a vowel-initial word when the preceding word is lengthened. An additional eye-tracking study (Experiment 3) using onset-overlap pairs (e.g., qafla /?afla/ - afda, /afda/ -> [?afda], Engl., 'to trust' - 'chord') showed no early influence of prosodic cues on segmental processing.

The current experiments assessed possible proximate mechanisms responsible for this advantage by assessing output strategies during free recall. Previous research has shown that item clustering during recall can provide diagnostic information about the structure of representations in episodic memory, particularly the encoding of temporal, semantic, and source information. Following survival processing and moving or pleasantness controls, measures of temporal and semantic clustering were generated. A robust recall advantage was found for survival processing, but no evidence for temporal clustering was detected. Above-chance levels of semantic clustering were obtained, but there were no differences between the survival and control conditions. An additional clustering measure based on scenario-based relevance ratings also failed to explain recall differences, as did absolute and relative measures of remembered temporal position. Our results indicate that neither enhanced temporal coding nor increased semantic processing among the items on the study list can easily explain the oft-replicated survival processing advantage. Our results also suggest that the ubiquitous temporal clustering patterns seen in free recall studies may be a product, in part, of using intentional learning and multiple study trials.

Distractor pictures were phonologically related, semantically related or unrelated to the target picture. Naming latencies were faster in the phonologically related condition (the phonological facilitation effect-PFE) than in the unrelated condition. No difference between semantically related and unrelated distractors was observed. In Experiment 2, participants were asked to name the color in which a picture was presented while ignoring the depicted object. Naming latencies were faster when colors and objects were phonologically related. In Experiments 3 and 4, the PFE was replicated under slightly different experimental conditions. Together, these results reveal that distractor pictures that are irrelevant to the communicative intention of the speaker activate their phonological content.

Five experiments examined the influence of the encoding process on the PSE in a step-by-step fashion, by using lists that consisted of phonologically similar (decoy) digit-(target) nonword pairs. Experiment 1 demonstrated the PSE when participants were required to recall both digits and nonwords. Experiment 2a used the same lists, but participants were required to recall either digits or nonwords (but not both). The PSE disappeared under these conditions but appeared again in Experiment 2b, in which the procedure was the same as Experiment 2a except that participants engaged in articulatory rehearsal during an 8 s recall delay. Experiment 2c replicated Experiments 2a and 2b, using a within-participants design. Experiment 3 demonstrated the PSE when participants articulated the digits as a distractor activity. These results suggest that encoding of phonologically similar items, including the re-encoding of items that is associated with rehearsal, disrupts other to-be-stored item information. This would be evidence for interference-based forgetting of item-specific information in short-term memory. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Experiment 1 replicated this reading time pattern but also showed that the individual differences were attributable to differential sensitivity to probabilistic constraints in the stimuli, in that only high span subjects were sensitive to the relative plausibility of alternative interpretations of the ambiguity.

In the present paper, we examine whether there is an early, automatic semantic priming effect across languages for noncognates with highly proficient (Basque/Spanish) bilinguals. Experiment I was a between-language masked semantic priming lexical decision experiment. Results showed a significant between-language semantic priming effect for both Basque-Spanish and Spanish-Basque pairs. Experiment 2 showed that the magnitude of the between-language and within-language masked semantic priming effects was quite similar. Experiment 3 replicated the findings of Experiment 2 with highly proficient bilinguals whose mother tongue was Spanish. Thus, highly fluent bilinguals develop early and automatic between-language links with noncognates at the semantic level, as predicted by the hierarchical revised model and the BIA+ model. We examine the implications of these results for models of bilingual memory. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

"Pimperton, Hannah; Nation, Kate",Suppressing irrelevant information from working memory: Evidence for domain-specific deficits in poor comprehenders,JOURNAL OF MEMORY AND LANGUAGE,"Previous research has suggested that children with specific reading comprehension deficits (poor comprehenders) show an impaired ability to suppress irrelevant information from working memory, with this deficit detrimentally impacting on their working memory ability, and consequently limiting their reading comprehension performance. However, the extent to which these suppression deficits are specific to the verbal domain has not yet been explored. Experiment 1 examined the memory profiles of poor comprehenders and demonstrated a memory deficit specific to working memory, and the verbal domain within working memory. Experiment 2 compared the same poor comprehenders and controls on both verbal and non-verbal versions of a proactive interference task designed to assess their ability to suppress no-longer-relevant information from working memory. The poor comprehenders showed domain-specific suppression deficits, demonstrating impairments relative to the controls only in the verbal version of the task. Experiment 3 replicated these findings after the response modes of the verbal and non-verbal tasks were equated, confirming the domain specificity of our sample of poor comprehenders' suppression deficits.

In three experiments, we examine whether stimulus-driven attention to items can improve retention of these items in working memory. Lists of phonologically-similar and dissimilar items were presented at expected or unexpected locations in Experiment 1. When stimulus-driven attention was captured by items presented at unexpected locations, similar items were better remembered than similar items that appeared at expected locations. These results were replicated in Experiment 2 using contingent capture to boost stimulus-driven attention to similar items. Experiment 3 demonstrated that stimulus-driven attention was beneficial for both similar and dissimilar items when the latter condition was made more difficult.

Students studied a list of words from taxonomic categories and then either restudied the word list several times or alternated between practice testing (either free recall or recognition) and restudy. Two days later, all groups completed final free recall and recognition tests. Replicating prior research, final free recall was greater after free recall practice versus recognition practice. Importantly, performance on measures of relational processing (clustering and category access) was greater following free recall practice versus recognition practice.

We first replicated Reali and Christiansen's (2007a) finding that pronominal object relative clauses are easier to process than analogous subject relative clauses (an effect which stands in contrast to previous research on pronominal relative clauses). We then analyzed corpus data to demonstrate that the embedded noun phrase in object relative clauses nearly always has a discourse-old referent, even if the noun phrase is not pronominal, while the referent of the embedded noun phrase in subject relative clauses is typically discourse-new. We then extended the work of Mak et al. (2008), by demonstrating in region-by-region reading that full noun phrase object relative clauses are not more difficult to process than subject relatives when they are preceded by appropriate discourse contexts. Finally, we reanalyzed data from the Dundee Eye-tracking corpus to show that contra Demberg and Keller (2007), naturally occurring object relatives are no harder to process than subject relatives. We conclude that the processing difficulties associated with object as compared to subject relative clauses arises because object relative clauses violate more discourse expectations in typical experimental contexts.

"Rummer, R; Engelkamp, J",Phonological information contributes to short-term recall of auditorily presented sentences,JOURNAL OF MEMORY AND LANGUAGE,"Potter and Lombardi (1990) suggested that verbatim short-term recall of sentences solely depends on conceptual and lexical information. In two experiments, we show that phonological information also contributes to short-term sentence recall. Modality of sentence presentation was varied, and a word list was presented before or after sentence presentation. It was assumed that phonological information contributes to the recall of auditorily presented sentences but not to sentences presented under rapid serial visual presentation. Therefore, better recall was expected for auditory than for visual sentence presentation. However, the advantage of auditory presentation should only appear if the word list preceded the sentences and did not interfere with phonological sentence information. Thus, word-list position should influence recall after auditory but not after visual sentence presentation, as in the latter case the impact of phonological information should be greatly reduced. The predictions were clearly confirmed. In addition, we replicated Potter and Lombardi's (1990) conceptually motivated intrusion effect.

"Rupprecht, Julia; Baeuml, Karl-Heinz T.",Retrieval-induced forgetting in item recognition: Retrieval specificity revisited,JOURNAL OF MEMORY AND LANGUAGE,"Retrieval-induced forgetting (RIF) refers to the finding that retrieval practice on a subset of studied items can induce later forgetting of related unpracticed items. Although previous studies indicated that RIF is retrieval specific - i.e., it arises after retrieval practice but not after reexposure cycles -, the results of more recent work suggest otherwise, indicating that some reexposure formats can induce RIF very similar to how retrieval practice does. Whereas this prior work employed recall at test, here we revisited retrieval specificity of RIF employing item recognition. The results of three experiments are reported, which examined the effects of retrieval practice and some of the recently suggested reexposure formats on unpracticed items' recognition. In each of these experiments, we showed RIF after retrieval practice but did not find any evidence for RIF-like forgetting after reexposure. These findings demonstrate retrieval specificity of RIF in item recognition, challenging strength-based accounts of RIF and indicating a critical role of inhibition in RIF. Together with the results from the recent recall studies, which we replicated in three further experiments, the present findings are consistent with a two-factor account of RIF, which assigns a role for both inhibition and strength-based blocking in RIF. While both inhibition and blocking may contribute to RIF in certain recall formats, only inhibition may induce RIF in item recognition. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

"Saito, S; Miyake, A",On the nature of forgetting and the processing-storage relationship in reading span performance,JOURNAL OF MEMORY AND LANGUAGE,"Four experiments examined the nature of forgetting and the processing-storage relationship during performance on a prevalent working memory task, the reading span test. Using two different presentation paradigms, Experiments I and 2 replicated Towse, Hitch, and Hutton's (1998, 2000) finding that the Short-Final lists, which presented a long sentence first and a short sentence last, led to better recall performance than the reverse-order Long-Final lists. This effect was still obtained when the retention duration for the target words was held constant and the amount of sentence processing required during that interval was varied (Experiment 3). However, the effect disappeared when the retention duration was varied while holding constant the amount of sentence processing required (Experiment 4). These results suggest that the amount of processing activities, not the sheer passage of time, may be the critical factor underlying the sentence order effect, thereby challenging purely time-based explanations of forgetting during reading span performance. In addition, the analysis of reading times (Experiment 1) revealed that the number of memory items had a subtle yet reliable negative effect on reading times, suggesting that the processing and storage requirements of the reading span test are not completely independent.

"Samuel, AG; Troicki, M",Articulation quality is inversely related to redundancy when children or adults have verbal control,JOURNAL OF MEMORY AND LANGUAGE,"Early research on spoken language established that words extracted from their original sentential contexts were often very hard to understand. Their intelligibility was modulated by the context from which they were taken: Words excised from highly predictive contexts were less intelligible than ones taken from less predictive contexts, suggesting that talkers compensate for weak context by improving articulation. Curiously, the only study to use children as talkers in this paradigm found the reverse pattern-better intelligibility of words from predictive contexts. Experiment 1 of the current study replicated this odd result, and showed that it only occurred when children were reading prepared materials; the normal adult-like pattern was found in the children's spontaneous conversation. Experiment 2 demonstrated that adults can be induced to produce the ''reverse'' pattern, when they are placed in a challenging reading situation. Experiment 3 showed that adults with high verbal skills produce the normal adult-like pattern when reading aloud, whereas adults with only average verbal skills do not. Collectively, the results indicate that the traditional effect of redundancy can be found only when talkers have good control of the production situation. Children as young as ten can in fact compensate for contextual weakness through articulatory enhancement, but only in conversational situations that afford such control.

"Savill, Nicola; Metcalfe, Tim; Ellis, Andrew W.; Jefferies, Elizabeth",Semantic categorisation of a word supports its phonological integrity in verbal short-term memory,JOURNAL OF MEMORY AND LANGUAGE,"In three immediate serial recall (ISR) experiments we tested the hypothesis that interactive processing between semantics and phonology supports phonological coherence in verbal short-term memory (STM). Participants categorised spoken words in six-item lists as they were presented, according to their semantic or phonological properties, then repeated the items in presentation order (Experiment 1). Despite matched categorisation performance between conditions, semantically-categorised words were correctly recalled more often than phonologically-categorised words. This accuracy advantage in the semantic condition was accompanied by fewer phoneme recombination errors. Comparisons with a no-categorisation ISR baseline (Experiment 2) indicated that, although categorisations were disruptive overall, recombination errors were specifically rarer following semantic categorisation. Experiment 3 replicated the key findings from Experiment 1 and also revealed fewer phonologically-related errors following semantic categorisation compared to a perceptual categorisation of high or low pitch. Therefore, augmented activation of semantic representations stabilises the phonological traces of words within verbal short-term memory, in line with the semantic binding hypothesis.

"Schotter, Elizabeth R.; Lee, Michelle; Reiderman, Michael; Rayner, Keith",The effect of contextual constraint on parafoveal processing in reading,JOURNAL OF MEMORY AND LANGUAGE,"Semantic preview benefit in reading is an elusive and controversial effect because empirical studies do not always (but sometimes) find evidence for it. Its presence seems to depend on (at least) the language being read, visual properties of the text (e.g., initial letter capitalization), the type of relationship between preview and target, and as shown here, semantic constraint generated by the prior sentence context. Schotter (2013) reported semantic preview benefit for synonyms, but not semantic associates when the preview/target was embedded in a neutral sentence context. In Experiment 1, we embedded those same previews/targets into constrained sentence contexts and in Experiment 2 we replicated the effects reported by Schotter (2013; in neutral sentence contexts) and Experiment 1 (in constrained contexts) in a within-subjects design. In both experiments, we found an early (i.e., first-pass) apparent preview benefit for semantically associated previews in constrained contexts that went away in late measures (e.g., total time). These data suggest that sentence constraint (at least as manipulated in the current study) does not operate by making a single word form expected, but rather generates expectations about what kinds of words are likely to appear. Furthermore, these data are compatible with the assumption of the E-Z Reader model that early oculomotor decisions reflect hedged bets that a word will be identifiable and, when wrong, lead the system to identify the wrong word, triggering regressions.

"Sera, MD; Gathje, J; Pintado, JD",Language and ontological knowledge: The contrast between objects and events made by Spanish and English speakers,JOURNAL OF MEMORY AND LANGUAGE,"What do differences across languages reflect about underlying category structure? This article focuses on how ontological divisions-the major divisions of entities in the world-are reflected in two languages. Experiments 1 and 2 investigated the contrast between objects and events among English and Spanish speakers by examining patterns of linguistic predicability-allowable combinations of nouns and predicates that constitute much of the evidence for ontological knowledge. Results from Experiment 1 replicated the previously documented ontological contrast between objects and events on the basis of temporal and physical predicates among adult speakers of both languages. However, Spanish speakers, unlike English speakers, distinguished objects from events on the basis of spatial predicates. In Experiment 2, the spatial distinction was found to develop according to the same trajectory in Spanish-speaking children as the temporal distinction develops in both English- and Spanish-speaking children, further suggesting an ontological contrast between objects and events based on spatial properties. Experiment 3 investigated the role of spatial and temporal properties in objects and events using a measure that did not rely on linguistic predicability. In this experiment, both speakers of English and Spanish judged variations in temporal and spatial properties as more likely to change the identity of events than of objects, indicating that the spatial linguistic contrast made by speakers of Spanish in Experiments 1 and 2 reflects an underlying conceptual contrast between objects and events that is made by both English and Spanish speakers-a contrast not previously documented in experimental psychology. This work offers new experimental evidence on the psychological distinction between objects and events and leads to a better understanding of the relation between language and ontological knowledge.

In Experiment 1. subjects categorized animals as large or small. The latencies showed an effect for serial position similar to the usual effect found for comparative judgments. In Experiment 2, subjects performed a standard comparative judgment for two linear orderings of animals, one in which magnitude categorization time was consistent across the order and the other in which magnitude categorization varied as a function of item magnitude. Results showed the usual bowed serial position effect for the heterogeneous ordering, but no such effect for the homogeneous ordering. Experiments 3 and 4 replicated the results of the first two experiments with different stimuli. In Experiment 5, subjects were precued with the size category of the to-be-compared items before malting a comparative judgment. Results demonstrated a direct effect of a category cue on judgments of relative size.

The effects of final phonological overlap between spoken monosyllabic target words and preceding primes on the recognition of those target words were examined. In Experiment 1, single-word shadowing latencies decreased as the number of phonemes shared between primes and targets increased. The greatest facilitation was observed when primes and targets rhymed. In Experiment 2, the number of shared phonemes was controlled. There was an influence of shared rime on shadowing performance in addition to that due to overlapping segments. Experiment 3 replicated this finding and showed that there was equivalent facilitation with word and nonword primes. Facilitation in shadowing short words was observed in Experiment 4 only when primes and targets rhymed. In Experiment 5, listeners responded to the same primes and targets as in Experiment 4; the items were presented for continuous lexical decision in an undifferentiated list. Facilitation was observed only when targets immediately followed primes with which they rhymed. Final-overlap facilitation appears to reflect two processes: a bias based on the perceptual salience of rhyme, and the activation of prelexical phonological representations.

Here, we report three eye-tracking experiments that test for parallelism effects both in coordinated noun phrases and in subordinate clauses. The first experiment replicated previous findings, showing that the second conjunct of a coordinated noun phrase was read more quickly when it had the same structure as the first conjunct, compared with when it did not. Experiment 2 examined parallelism effects in noun phrases that were not linked by coordination. Again, a reading time advantage was found when the second noun phrase had the same structure as the first. Experiment 3 compared parallelism effects in coordinated and non-coordinated syntactic environments. The parallelism effect was replicated for both environments, and was statistically equivalent whether or not coordination was involved. This demonstrated that parallelism effects can be found outside the environment of coordination, suggesting a general syntactic priming mechanism as the underlying explanation. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

"Tabor, W; Galantucci, B; Richardson, D",Effects of merely local syntactic coherence on sentence processing,JOURNAL OF MEMORY AND LANGUAGE,"A central question for psycholinguistics concerns the role of grammatical constraints in online sentence processing. Many current theories maintain that the language processing mechanism constructs a parse or parses that are grammatically consistent with the whole of the perceived input each time it processes a word. Several bottom-up, dynamical models make a contrasting prediction: partial parses which are syntactically compatible with only a proper subpart of the input are sometimes constructed, at least temporarily. Three self-paced reading experiments probed for interference from such locally coherent structures. The first tested for a distracting effect of irrelevant Subject-Predicate interpretations of Noun Phrase Verb Phrase sequences (e.g., The coach smiled at the player tossed a frisbee) on reading times. The second addressed the question of whether the interference effects can be treated as lexical interference, instead of involving the formation of locally coherent syntactic structures. The third replicated the reading time effects of the first two experiments with grammaticality judgments. We evaluate the dynamical account, comparing it to other approaches that also predict effects of local coherence, and arguing against accounts which rule out the formation of merely locally coherent structures.

"Urbach, Thomas P.; Kutas, Marta",Quantifiers more or less quantify on-line: ERP evidence for partial incremental interpretation,JOURNAL OF MEMORY AND LANGUAGE,"Event-related brain potentials were recorded during RSVP reading to test the hypothesis that quantifier expressions are incrementally interpreted fully and immediately. In sentences tapping general knowledge (Farmers grow crops/worms as their primary source of income), Experiment 1 found larger N400s for atypical (worms) than typical objects (crops). Experiment 2 crossed object typicality with non-logical subject noun phrase quantifiers (most, few). Offline plausibility ratings exhibited the crossover interaction predicted by full quantifier interpretation: Most farmers grow crops and Few farmers grow worms were rated more plausible than Most farmers grow worms and Few farmers grow crops. Object N400s, although modulated in the expected direction, did not reverse. Experiment 3 replicated these findings with adverbial quantifiers (Farmers often/rarely grow crops/worms). Interpretation of quantifier expressions thus is neither fully immediate nor fully delayed. Furthermore, object atypicality was associated with a frontal slow positivity in few-type/rarely quantifier contexts, suggesting systematic processing differences among quantifier types.

"Velan, Hadas; Frost, Ram",Letter-transposition effects are not universal: The impact of transposing letters in Hebrew,JOURNAL OF MEMORY AND LANGUAGE,"We examined the effects of letter-transposition in Hebrew in three masked-priming experiments. Hebrew, like English has an alphabetic orthography where sequential and contiguous letter strings represent phonemes. However, being a Semitic language it has a non-concatenated morphology that is based on root derivations. Experiment I showed that transposed-letter (TL) root primes inhibited responses to targets derived from the non-transposed root letters, and that this inhibition was unrelated to relative root frequency. Experiment 2 replicated this result and showed that if the transposed letters of the root created a nonsense-root that had no lexical representation, then no inhibition and no facilitation were obtained. Finally, Experiment 3 demonstrated that in contrast to English, French, or Spanish, TL nonword primes did not facilitate recognition of targets, and when the root letters embedded in them consisted of a legal root morpheme, they produced inhibition. These results suggest that lexical space in alphabetic orthographies may be structured very differently in different languages if their morphological structure diverges qualitatively. In Hebrew, lexical space is organized according to root families rather than simple orthographic structure, so that all words derived from the same root are interconnected or clustered together, independent of overall orthographic similarity.

"Veldre, Aaron; Andrews, Sally",How does foveal processing difficulty affect parafoveal processing during reading?,JOURNAL OF MEMORY AND LANGUAGE,"Models of eye movement control during reading assume that the difficulty of processing word n in a sentence modulates the depth of processing of the upcoming word/s (word n + 1) in the parafovea. This foveal load hypothesis is widely accepted in the literature despite surprisingly few clear replications of the basic effect. We sought to establish whether observing a foveal load effect depends on the type of parafoveal preview used in the boundary paradigm. Participants' eye movements were recorded in two experiments as they read sentences in which a low- or high-frequency word n-a typical manipulation of foveal load-preceded a critical target word. Prior to the reader making a saccade to word n + 1, the parafoveal preview was either identical to word n + 1; an orthographically similar word or nonword; or an unrelated word or nonword. The results revealed that the critical evidence for a foveal load effect-an interaction between word n frequency and word n + 1 preview-was limited to conditions in which the invalid preview baseline was an orthographically illegal nonword. The remaining conditions produced completely additive effects of the two factors. These findings raise questions about the mechanisms underlying the spillover of foveal processing difficulty to parafoveal words. The implications for theories of reading are discussed.",8,DEC,2018,103,,74,90,,10.1016/j.jml.2018.08.001,1,0,no clear communication of intent to replicate an original study,0,,,,,NA,,,,,,,NA,,NA,8,,
"Vroomen, J; Tuomainen, J; de Gelder, B",The roles of word stress and vowel harmony in speech segmentation,JOURNAL OF MEMORY AND LANGUAGE,"Three experiments investigated the role of word stress and vowel harmony in speech segmentation. Finnish has fixed word stress on the initial syllable, and vowels from a front or back harmony set cannot co-occur within a word. In Experiment 1, we replicated the results of Suomi, McQueen, and Cutler (1997) showing that Finns use a mismatch in vowel harmony as a word boundary cue when the target-initial syllable is unstressed. Listeners found it easier to detect words such as HYmy in PUhymy (harmony mismatch) than in PYhymy (no harmony mismatch). In Experiment 2, words had stressed target-initial syllables (HYmy as in pyHYmy or puHYmy). Reaction times were now faster and the vowel harmony effect was greatly reduced. In Experiment 3, Finnish, Dutch, and French listeners learned to segment an artificial language. Performance was best when the phonological properties of the artificial language marched those of the native one. Finns profited, as in the previous experiments, from vowel harmony and word-initial stress; Dutch profited from word-initial stress, and French did not profit either from vowel-harmony or from word-initial stress. Vowel disharmony and word-initial stress are thus language-specific cues to word boundaries.

False recognitions occur when participants incorrectly claim that lures had been studied, and they are higher for lures that are phonetically or semantically related to studied words. Brainerd, Reyna, and Kneer (1995) reported that priming a critical lure by testing its related studied word in the preceding position reduced false recognition to a level well below the control rate (false-recognition reversal). Three experiments are reported that failed to replicate false-recognition reversal at the impressive levels reported by Brainerd et al. For some critical contrasts, false recognition to primed lures was significantly higher than to new control lures. For some experimental comparisons there was evidence that priming led to false-recognition suppression, but none of the critical contrasts showed that false recognition was significantly higher to new control lures than to primed experimental lures.

The present study investigated the impact of translation activation in three behavioural experiments with in total 118 Chinese-English bilinguals. First, we investigated whether Chinese phonology was the source of the effects of Chinese character repetition in the Chinese translations of English masked primes and targets (hidden repetition priming) observed in Zhang et al.'s (2011), and whether these hidden repetition priming effects were affected by Chinese morpheme complexity and prime duration. However, we failed to find any evidence of hidden repetition priming. An exact replication of Zhang et al. (2011) was conducted next, which again provided no evidence for hidden repetition priming. However, cross-language priming data collected with the same group of participants did reveal masked translation priming and crucially Chinese character repetition priming with masked Chinese primes and English targets (partially hidden repetition priming), indicating that the activation of Chinese translations in the masked priming paradigm is limited to English target words.

Experiments 1 to 3 exploit a modified version of the Sternbeg et al. (1978, 1980) prepared speech production paradigm to look for evidence of the generation of prosodic structure during the final stages of sentence production. Experiment 1 provides evidence that prepared sentence production latency is a function of the number of phonological words that a sentence comprises when syntactic structure, number of lexical items, and number of syllables are held constant. Experiment 2 demonstrated that production latencies in Experiment 1 were indeed determined by prosodic structure rather than the number of content words that a sentence comprised. The phonological word effect was replicated in Experiment 3 using utterances with a different intonation pattern and phrasal structure. Finally, in Experiment 4, an on-line version of the sentence production task provides evidence for the phonological word as the preferred unit of articulation during the on-line production of continuous speech. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the phonological word is a unitof processing during the phonological encoding of connected speech.

"WHEELDON, LR; LEVELT, WJM",MONITORING THE TIME-COURSE OF PHONOLOGICAL ENCODING,JOURNAL OF MEMORY AND LANGUAGE,"Three experiments examined the time course of phonological encoding in speech production. A new methodology is introduced in which subjects are required to monitor their internal speech production for prespecified target segments and syllables. Experiment 1 demonstrated that word initial target segments are monitored significantly faster than second syllable initial target segments. The addition of a concurrent articulation task (Experiment 1b) had a limited effect on performance, excluding the possibility that subjects are monitoring a subvocal articulation of the carrier word. Moreover, no relationship was observed between the pattern of monitoring latencies and the timing of the targets in subjects' overt speech. Subjects are not, therefore, monitoring an internal phonetic representation of the carrier word. Experiment 2 used the production monitoring task to replicate the syllable monitoring effect observed in speech perception experiments. responses to targets were faster when they corresponded to the initial syllable of the carrier word than when they did not. We conclude that subjects are monitoring their internal generation of a syllabified phonological representation. Experiment 3 provides more detailed evidence concerning the time course of the generation of this representation by comparing monitoring latencies to targets within, as well as between, syllables. Some amendments to current models of phonological encoding are suggested in light of these results.

"Wissman, Kathryn T.; Rawson, Katherine A.",Why does collaborative retrieval improve memory? Enhanced relational and item-specific processing,JOURNAL OF MEMORY AND LANGUAGE,"Engaging in collaborative retrieval practice increases performance on subsequent memory tests taken individually (Blumen & Stern, 2011). However, the basis of these post-collaborative benefits is largely unexplained. Thus, the primary goal of the current research was to investigate the cognitive mechanisms underlying post-collaborative benefits vis--vis the theoretical framework of distinctiveness theory, which postulates that two processes influence memory. Relational processing refers to the encoding of similarity among a set of items, whereas item-specific processing refers to the encoding of information that differentiates items from one another. The central claim of distinctiveness theory is that memory is enhanced when differences among individual items are processed in the context of the similarity among those items (referred to as distinctive processing). The basic design of all three experiments was similar (i.e., close replications with intent to provide multiple estimates of effect sizes on which to base conclusions): Learners were asked to study lists of exemplars from taxonomic categories, followed by recall practice that occurred either collaboratively or individually. All learners completed individual final tests, immediately after practice and/or after a delay. Of greatest theoretical interest for diagnosing the extent to which post-collaborative benefits reflect distinctive processing, we examined indicators of relational processing (clustering and category access) and item-specific processing (items recalled per category and recognition performance). Results across the three experiments established that distinctive processing (i.e., enhancements in both relational and item-specific processing) contributes to post-collaborative benefits across both short and long retention intervals.

"Wurm, LH; Samuel, AG",Lexical inhibition and attentional allocation during speech perception: Evidence from phoneme monitoring,JOURNAL OF MEMORY AND LANGUAGE,"The TRACE model (McClelland & Elman, 1986) predicts lexically-driven inhibition at the phonemic level. This is due to the combination of top-down excitatory connections from this lexical to the phonemic level, and inhibitory connections between competing units within the phonemic level. Frauenfelder, Segui, and Dijkstra (1990, Experiment 2) tested this prediction hi French and found no evidence of such inhibition. Experiment I of the current study replicated their results with English stimuli: Instead of having longer reaction times (RTs), targets in Inhibiting Nonwords (INWs) were detected just as fast as targets in control nonwords. Our Experiment 2 improved the design of the original experiment by adding a more appropriate: control condition, increasing the number of critical items, and employing balanced target locations and conditional target probabilities. Under these conditions, RTs to INWs were significantly faster than baseline RTs, an effect opposite in direction to the hypothesized inhibition. Experiment 3 used a dual-task paradigm to examine the attentional demands of processing different types of nonwords. In addition to performing the phoneme monitoring task as before, subjects also monitored a pure tone for frequency modulations. The RT advantage for INWs was replicated in this experiment for both phoneme and modulation targets. In Experiment 4 we replicated the: INW advantage for both phoneme and modulation targets, and found that the advantage disappeared for stimuli that carried both types of targets. The results suggest that both lexical inhibition and attentional allocation affect phoneme perception; their interaction can mask the effect of each.

"Yan, Ming; Luo, Yingyi; Inhoff, Albrecht W.",Syllable articulation influences foveal and parafoveal processing of words during the silent reading of Chinese sentences,JOURNAL OF MEMORY AND LANGUAGE,"The current study examined effects of syllable articulation on eye movements during the silent reading of Chinese sentences, which contained two types of two-character target words whose second characters were subject to dialect-specific variation. In one condition the second syllable was articulated with a neutral tone for northern-dialect Chinese speakers and with a full tone for southern-dialect Chinese speakers (neutral-tone target words) and in the other condition the second syllable was articulated with a full tone irrespective of readers' dialect type (full-tone target words). Native speakers of northern and southern Chinese dialects were recruited in Experiment 1 to examine the effect of dialect-specific articulation on silent reading. Recordings of their eye movements revealed shorter viewing durations for neutral- than for full-tone target words only for speakers of northern but not for southern dialects, indicating that dialect-specific articulation of syllabic tone influenced visual word recognition. Experiment 2 replicated the syllabic tone effect for speakers of northern dialects, and the use of gaze-contingent display changes further revealed that these readers processed an upcoming parafoveal word less effectively when a neutral- than when a full-tone target was fixated. Shorter viewing duration for neutral-tone words thus cannot be attributed to their easier lexical processing; instead, tonal effects appear to reflect Chinese readers' simulated articulation of to-be-recognized words during silent reading.

"Yeung, H. Henny; Chen, Ke Heng; Werker, Janet F.",When does native language input affect phonetic perception? The precocious case of lexical tone,JOURNAL OF MEMORY AND LANGUAGE,"Previous studies have suggested that the perception of vowels and consonants changes from language-universal to language-specific between 6 and 12 months of age. This report suggests that language-specific perception emerges even earlier for lexical tones. Experiment 1 tested English-learners' perception of Cantonese tones, replicating declines in tone discrimination from 4 to 9 months of age. Experiment 2 tested infants learning non-native versus native tone systems (Mandarin-learners versus Cantonese-learners). All Chinese-learners discriminated the tones, but showed language-specific differences in tone preferences at both ages. Indeed, English-, Mandarin-, and Cantonese-learning 4-month-olds all exhibited distinct preferences. With other work, this shows that language-specific speech perception emerges over a more complex and extended schedule than previously thought: first for lexical stress aid tone (<5 months), then vowels (6-8 months), consonants (8.5-12 months), and finally phoneme duration (18 months). Acoustic salience likely plays an important role in determining the timing of phonetic development. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

"Yoon, Si On; Brown-Schmidt, Sarah",Lexical differentiation in language production and comprehension,JOURNAL OF MEMORY AND LANGUAGE,"This paper presents the results of three experiments that explore the breadth of the relevant discourse context in language production and comprehension. Previous evidence from language production suggests the relevant context is quite broad, based on findings that speakers differentiate new discourse referents from similar referents discussed in past contexts (Van Der Wege, 2009). Experiment 1 replicated and extended this lexical differentiation effect by demonstrating that speakers used two different mechanisms, modification, and the use of subordinate level nouns, to differentiate current from past referents. In Experiments 2 and 3, we examined whether addressees expect speakers to differentiate. The results of these experiments did not support the hypothesis that listeners expect differentiation, for either lexically differentiated modified expressions (Experiment 2), nor for subordinate level nouns (Experiment 3). Taken together, the present findings suggest that the breadth of relevant discourse context differs across language production and comprehension. Speakers show more sensitivity to things they have said before, possibly due to better knowledge of the relevant context. In contrast, listeners have the task of inferring what the speaker believes is the relevant context: this inferential process may be more error-prone. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

"Zelinski, EM; Hyde, JC","Old words, new meanings: Aging and sense creation",JOURNAL OF MEMORY AND LANGUAGE,"We assessed adult age differences in interpretations of eponymous noun phrases (e.g., do an Elvis Edmunds). In Experiment 1, young and old participants produced interpretations after reading vignettes describing three actions of fictitious eponyms. One of the actions was the intended interpretation, and cues either did or did not restrict the interpretation to that action. Although both age groups were sensitive to interpretation cues, young adults were likely to produce the intended interpretation, but older participants generalized across all actions. The results of Experiment 2 replicated this pattern under conditions in which subjects received more practice and misleading contextual information was removed. Experiment 3 tested whether older adults' tendency to generalize was due to the retrieval requirements of production by using a verification task. Older participants did not differ from the young in verifying intended interpretations but were at chance in rejecting generalizations, suggesting that older adults may have a deficit in semantic processing.

In an auditory lexical decision task, phonological neighborhood (PN) produced the standard inhibitory effect (words with many neighbors produced longer latencies and more errors than words with few neighbors). In contrast, orthographic neighborhood (ON) produced a facilitatory effect. In Experiment 2, the facilitatory ON effect was replicated while controlling for phonotactic probability, a variable that has previously been shown to produce facilitatory effects. In Experiment 3, the results were replicated in a shadowing task, ruling out the possibility that the ON effect results from a strategic and task-specific mechanism that might operate in the lexical decision task. It is argued that the PN effect reflects lexical competition between similar sounding words while the ON effect reflects the consistency of the sublexical mapping between phonology and orthography. The results join an accumulating number of studies suggesting that orthographic information influences auditory word recognition. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

"ZIEGLER, JC; JACOBS, AM",PHONOLOGICAL INFORMATION PROVIDES EARLY SOURCES OF CONSTRAINT IN THE PROCESSING OF LETTER STRINGS,JOURNAL OF MEMORY AND LANGUAGE,"Three experiments addressed the role of phonological information in visual word recognition using a letter search task. Subjects were presented with a target letter (e.g., ''I'') followed by a letter string (a word, a pseudohomophone, a pseudoword control, or a nonword). Their task was to indicate whether the target letter was present in the letter string. All experiments presented pseudohomophones (e.g., TAIP or BRANE) that either contained a letter (I) that was absent in their sound-alike word (TAPE) or were missing a letter (I) that was present in their sound-alike word (BRAIN). In Experiments 1 and 2, subjects made more miss errors under data-limited conditions when the letter string was a target-present pseudohomophone (TAIP) and more false alarm errors when the letter string was a target-absent pseudohomophone (BRANE). Experiment 2 controlled for a possible confound in the data in terms of word completion strategies. In Experiment 3, we replicated the pseudohomophone disadvantage using resource-limited conditions: detection times were longer for pseudohomophones. The existence of a pseudohomophone disadvantage in a supposedly graphemic task adds further support to the accumulating evidence that phonological information generated from the printed word is an early and major constraint in visual word recognition.

"Ziegler, JC; Montant, M; Jacobs, AM",The feedback consistency effect in lexical decision and naming,JOURNAL OF MEMORY AND LANGUAGE,"Previous consistency research investigated inconsistency only in the mapping of spelling to phonology (feedforward inconsistency). The present experiments investigated whether inconsistency in the mapping of phonology to spelling (feedback inconsistency) would also affect visual word perception. In Experiment 1, we replicated the basic feedback consistency effect previously obtained by Stone, Vanhoy, and Van Orden (1997) in a lexical-decision task. Lexical-decision latencies and errors were increased when a word's phonological rhyme could be spelled in multiple ways. In Experiment 2, we showed that both feedforward and feedback consistency affected lexical-decision performance to the same extent. In Experiment 3, feedback consistency effects persisted in immediate naming, but they were smaller and less reliable than feedforward consistency effects. A portion of the feedforward consistency effects persisted in delayed naming. Our results suggest that a part of both feedforward and feedback consistency effects seem to be modulated by task specific properties (e.g., spelling check in lexical decision or ease of generating articulatory programs in naming). However, another part seems to uncover a task-independent basic principle underlying word perception: the bidirectional coupling of orthography and phenology.
